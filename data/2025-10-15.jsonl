In common eye-tracking\nstudies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets\nsuch as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods\nto extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here,\nresearchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code\nblocks, and the difference leads to different results. Moreover, the\ninterpretation of fixation for word/line can vary across the purposes of the\nanalyses. Hence, the eye-tracking analysis is a difficult task that depends on\nthe time-consuming manual work of the researchers. eye2vec represents\ncontinuous two fixations as transitions between syntactic elements using\ndistributed representations. The distributed representation facilitates the\nadoption of diverse data analysis methods with rich semantic interpretations."}

Yet the\neffectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and\nnoise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring\nstreams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally\nunsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in\nLLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but\nthe challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention\nbudget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design\nprinciple for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as\ncompression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most\nrelevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building\nbenchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating\ntoken-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our\nvision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in\nnoisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable\nLLM--data integration."}

Yet, their adoption in\npractice has been hampered by the lack of such specifications in real world\ncode. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in inferring formal\npostconditions from natural language hints embedded in code such as function\nnames, comments or documentation. Using the generated postconditions as\nspecifications in a subsequent verification, however, often leads verifiers to\nsuggest invalid inputs, hinting at potential issues that ultimately turn out to\nbe false alarms.\n  To address this, we revisit the problem of specification inference from\nnatural language in the context of automatic software verification. In the\nprocess, we introduce NL2Contract, the task of employing LLMs to translate\ninformal natural language into formal functional contracts, consisting of\npostconditions as well as preconditions. We introduce metrics to validate and\ncompare different NL2Contract approaches, using soundness, bug discriminative\npower of the generated contracts and their usability in the context of\nautomatic software verification as key metrics. We evaluate NL2Contract with\ndifferent LLMs and compare it to the task of postcondition generation\nnl2postcond. Our evaluation shows that (1) LLMs are generally effective at\ngenerating functional contracts sound for all possible inputs, (2) the\ngenerated contracts are sufficiently expressive for discriminating buggy from\ncorrect behavior, and (3) verifiers supplied with LLM inferred functional\ncontracts produce fewer false alarms than when provided with postconditions\nalone.
