This paper\nchallenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage,\nperformance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks\nto the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our\napproach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art\nLLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using\nHumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness\nand runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization,\nand CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language,\ndevelopment stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we\npresent PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each\ntask context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without\nrequiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over\nstrong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37%\non HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and\n49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance\noptimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median\nspeedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The\nframework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing\nnew LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm\nfor production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly\nevolving generative AI landscape."}

Objective: This study examines the prevalence and reasons behind\nissues being labeled as wontfix across various open-source repositories on\nGitHub. Method: Employing a mixed-method approach, we analyze both quantitative\ndata to assess the prevalence of the wontfix label and qualitative data to\nexplore the reasoning that it was used. Data were collected from 3,132 of\nGitHub's most-popular repositories. Later, we employ open coding and thematic\nanalysis to categorize the reasons behind wontfix labels, providing a\nstructured understanding of the issue management landscape. Results: Our\nfindings show that about 30% of projects on GitHub apply the wontfix label to\nsome issues. These issues most often occur on user-submitted issues for bug\nreports and feature requests. The study identified eight common themes behind\nlabeling issues as wontfix, ranging from user-specific control factors to\nmaintainer-specific decisions. Conclusions: The wontfix label is a critical\ntool for managing resources and guiding contributor efforts in GitHub projects.\nHowever, it can also discourage community involvement and obscure the\ntransparency of project management.

The energy consumption of\nAndroid apps could be estimated via software-based and hardware-based\napproaches. Software-based approaches, while easier to implement, are not as\naccurate as hardware-based approaches. The process of measuring the energy\nconsumption of an Android app via a hardware-based approach typically involves\n1) setting up a measurement environment, 2) executing the app under test on a\nmobile device, 3) recording current/voltage data via a hardware device to\nmeasure energy consumption, and 4) cleaning and aggregating data for analyses,\nreports, and visualizations.

Previous\nmachine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the\nautoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values.\nDue to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has\na huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large\nnumber of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the\nnon-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code\nin a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the\nNAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch\nquality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper\npropose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR\ntask. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the\nrepair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the\ninter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking\ninter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for\nalleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair\non three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that\n1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best\nperformance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR\ntechniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times\nin the GPU environment.

Recent lightweight static analysis techniques improve efficiency\nover SDG-based methods, but they still suffer from a high rate of false\npositives. A key cause of these false positives is the presence of\nbehavior-preserving code refactorings, which current techniques cannot\neffectively distinguish from changes that impact behavior and can interfere\nwith others. To handle this problem we present RefFilter, a refactoring-aware\ntool for semantic interference detection. It builds on existing static\ntechniques by incorporating automated refactoring detection to improve\nprecision. RefFilter discards behavior-preserving refactorings from reports,\nreducing false positives while preserving detection coverage. To evaluate\neffectiveness and scalability, use two datasets: a labeled dataset with 99\nscenarios and ground truth, and a novel dataset of 1,087 diverse merge\nscenarios that we have built. Experimental results show that RefFilter reduces\nfalse positives by nearly 32% on the labeled dataset. While this reduction\ncomes with a non significant increase in false negatives, the overall gain in\nprecision significantly outweighs the minor trade-off in recall.
