Directive-based parallel\nprogramming standards like OpenACC simplify GPU programming to some extent by\nabstracting away low-level complexities, but a fair amount of expertise is\nstill required in order to use those directives effectively.\n  We introduce ACCeLLiuM, two open weights Large Language Models specifically\nfine-tuned for generating expert OpenACC directives for data-parallel loops,\nalong with the supervised fine-tuning dataset that was used to train them. The\nACCeLLiuM SFT dataset contains 4,033 OpenACC pragma-loop pairs mined from\npublic GitHub C/C++ repositories, with 3,223 pairs for training and 810 for\ntesting. Experimental evaluations show a pronounced performance gap in\ngenerating correct OpenACC pragmas between base LLMs and our fine-tuned\nversions. On the held-out test set, base LLMs fail to consistently generate\nvalid pragmas, whereas LLMs fine-tuned on the ACCeLLiuM dataset generate valid\npragmas with the correct directive type for $87\\%$ of the data-parallel loops,\nand exact pragmas--including directives, clauses, clause order, and clause\nvariables--for $50\\%$ of the cases. Even when not exact, generated pragmas\nfrequently incorporate the correct clauses in a different order than the\nground-truth label, or include additional clauses that enable finer control\nover parallel execution, data movement, and concurrency, offering practical\nvalue beyond strict string-matching. By publicly releasing the code, models,\nand dataset as ACCeLLiuM we hope to establish a reproducible benchmark for\nLLM-powered OpenACC pragma generation, and lower the barrier to automated GPU\noffloading of serially written programs."}
