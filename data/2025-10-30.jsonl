Existing benchmarks assess only\nend-to-end build/test success, obscuring where and why agents succeed or fail.\nWe introduce the Environment Configuration Diagnosis Benchmark, Enconda-bench,\nwhich provides process-level trajectory assessment of fine-grained agent\ncapabilities during environment setup-planning, perception-driven error\ndiagnosis, feedback-driven repair, and action to execute final environment\nconfiguration. Our task instances are automatically constructed by injecting\nrealistic README errors and are validated in Docker for scalable, high-quality\nevaluation. Enconda-bench combines process-level analysis with end-to-end\nexecutability to enable capability assessments beyond aggregate success rates.\nEvaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs and agent frameworks show that while\nagents can localize errors, they struggle to translate feedback into effective\ncorrections, limiting end-to-end performance. To our knowledge, Enconda-bench\nis the first framework to provide process-level internal capability assessment\nfor environment configuration, offering actionable insights for improving\nsoftware engineering agents."}
