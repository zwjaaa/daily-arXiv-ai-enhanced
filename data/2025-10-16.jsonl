Authors must: set\nconstraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts;\ntarget specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data\nstructures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We\nargue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model\ncapabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce\nAutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade\nproblem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites\napproach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement\nover current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than\n81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create\nnovel variants with reference and brute-force solutions.

Ensuring compiler correctness is critical. However,\nisolating compiler bugs remains challenging due to the internal complexity of\ncompiler execution. Existing techniques primarily mutate compilation inputs to\ngenerate passing and failing tests, but often lack causal analysis of internal\nsteps, limiting their effectiveness.\n  To address this limitation, we propose CompSCAN, a novel compiler bug\nisolation technique that applies analysis over the sequence of compilation\nsteps. CompSCAN follows a three-stage process: (1) extracting the array of\ncompilation steps that leads to the original failure, (2) identifying\nbug-causing steps and collecting corresponding compiler code elements, and (3)\ncalculating suspicious scores for each code element and outputting a suspicious\nranking list as the bug isolation result.\n  We evaluate CompSCAN on 185 real-world LLVM and GCC bugs. Results show that\nCompSCAN outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both effectiveness and\nefficiency. CompSCAN successfully isolates 50, 85, 100, and 123 bugs within the\nTop-1/3/5/10 ranks, respectively.

Standard compiler heuristics offer general applicability but\noften yield suboptimal, program-specific results due to their one-size-fits-all\nnature. While iterative compilation can find tailored solutions, its\nprohibitive search cost limits practical use. Machine learning approaches\npromise faster inference but frequently struggle with generalization to unseen\nprograms. This paper introduces GRACE, a novel framework for compiler\nauto-tuning, demonstrated for LLVM IR instruction count optimization. GRACE\neffectively curtails the search space by leveraging pass synergies and a\nweighted scoring method to generate initial high-quality candidate sequences\nand a pass pool. It then employs contrastive learning, using pass\nsequence-based data augmentation, to create program embeddings that facilitate\nsimilarity-aware clustering. Evolutionary search within these clusters yields a\ncoreset of $k$ specialized pass sequences designed for robust generalization to\nunseen programs. At test time, GRACE efficiently selects the best coreset\nsequence and refines it using lightweight techniques. Experimental results on\nseven diverse datasets show that GRACE reduces LLVM IR instruction count by an\naverage of 10.09% on LLVM 10.0.0 and 10.19% on LLVM 18.1.6 compared to opt -Oz,\nwhile incurring an average tuning time of less than 1s per program,\ndemonstrating its state-of-the-art performance and practical effectiveness."}

This misalignment prevents\nthem from guaranteeing the generation of syntactically valid optimization\npipelines. In this work, we present a new auto-tuning framework built from the\nground up for the New Pass Manager. We introduce a formal grammar to define the\nspace of valid nested pipelines and a forest-based data structure for their\nnative representation. Upon this foundation, we develop a structure-aware\nGenetic Algorithm whose operators manipulate these forests directly, ensuring\nthat all candidate solutions are valid by construction.
