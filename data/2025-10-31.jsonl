However, traditional risk management, narrowly focused on\ntechnical tools, is structurally inadequate for systemic threats like upstream\n\"silent fixes\", community conflicts, or sudden license changes, creating a\ndangerous governance blind spot. To address this governance vacuum and enable\nthe necessary shift from tactical risk management to holistic risk governance,\nwe conducted a grounded theory study with 15 practitioners to develop a\nholistic risk governance framework. Our study formalizes an analytical\nframework built on a foundational risk principle: an uncontrollable External\nThreat (e.g., a sudden license change in a key dependency) only becomes a\ncritical risk when it exploits a controllable Internal Vulnerability (e.g., an\nundefined risk appetite for single-vendor projects), which then amplifies the\nimpact.The framework operationalizes this principle through a clear logical\nchain: \"Objectives -> Threats -> Vulnerabilities -> Mitigation\" (OTVM). This\nprovides a holistic decision model that transcends mere technical checklists.\nBased on this logic, our contributions are: (1) a \"Strategic Objectives Matrix\"\nto clarify goals; (2) a systematic dual taxonomy of External Threats (Ex-Tech,\nEx-Comm, Ex-Eco) and Internal Vulnerabilities (In-Strat, In-Ops, In-Tech); and\n(3) an actionable mitigation framework mapping capability-building to these\nvulnerabilities. The framework's analytical utility was validated by three\nindustry experts through retrospective case studies on real-world incidents.\nThis work provides a novel diagnostic lens and a systematic path for\nenterprises to shift from reactive \"firefighting\" to proactively building an\norganizational \"immune system\"."}

Synovic contributed\n  equally to this work (co-first authors); Mona Rahimi and George K.\n  Thiruvathukal contributed equally to this work (co-supervisors)", "summary": "Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed,\nrevealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical\nfactors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of\nvulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that\nlead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process\nmetrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are\nessential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work\nhighlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in\nunderstanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond\nfile-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level,\nfocusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also\non the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and\nre-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of\none isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and\nsocio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study\non the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as\nbus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction\nactivities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our\nfindings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage\nand fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue\nmanagement and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for\nbroader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes\nand strengthen software security."}

However,\nupdating libraries and frameworks remains a time consuming and error-prone\nprocess. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic coding\nsystems offer new opportunities for automating such maintenance tasks. In this\npaper, we evaluate the update of a well-known Python library, SQLAlchemy,\nacross a dataset of ten client applications. For this task, we use the Github's\nCopilot Agent Mode, an autonomous AI systema capable of planning and executing\nmulti-step migration workflows. To assess the effectiveness of the automated\nmigration, we also introduce Migration Coverage, a metric that quantifies the\nproportion of API usage points correctly migrated. The results of our study\nshow that the LLM agent was capable of migrating functionalities and API usages\nbetween SQLAlchemy versions (migration coverage: 100%, median), but failed to\nmaintain the application functionality, leading to a low test-pass rate\n(39.75%, median)."}

Log parsing, which converts semi-structured log\ndata into structured log data, is often the first step in automated log\nanalysis. Given the wide range of log parsers utilizing diverse techniques, it\nis essential to evaluate them to understand their characteristics and\nperformance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study\ncomparing syntax- and semantic-based log parsers, as well as single-phase and\ntwo-phase parsing architectures. Our experiments reveal that semantic-based\nmethods perform better at identifying the correct templates and syntax-based\nlog parsers are 10 to 1,000 times more efficient and provide better grouping\naccuracy although they fall short in accurate template identification.\nMoreover, two-phase architecture consistently improves accuracy compared to\nsingle-phase architecture. Based on the findings of this study, we propose\nSynLog+, a template identification module that acts as the second phase in a\ntwo-phase log parsing architecture. SynLog+ improves the parsing accuracy of\nsyntax-based and semantic-based log parsers by 236\\% and 20\\% on average,\nrespectively, with virtually no additional runtime cost."}
