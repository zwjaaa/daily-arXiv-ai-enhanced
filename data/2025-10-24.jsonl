However, finding test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely\nchallenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites\nover extended periods.\n  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between\nthe execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced\nafter testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore\nexecution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions\nthat have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those\nmonitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases\nthat enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to\npinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and\naugments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.\n  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred\nopen-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates\nthat E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better\nthan state-of-the-art approaches.

Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have\nquickly gained popularity.

They are capable of\nautomatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,\nor destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment\nwith the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,\nor SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure\ndrift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may\nundo valid updates or trigger errors.\n  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates\nout-of-band changes back into the IaC program.

NSync gleans insights from API\ntraces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update\nthe IaC configuration to capture the changes).
