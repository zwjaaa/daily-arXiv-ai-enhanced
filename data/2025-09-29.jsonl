While recent LLM-based and\nLLM-agent-based approaches improve accuracy, they struggle in large-scale\nrepositories due to concern mixing, where relevant logic is buried in large\nfunctions, and concern scattering, where related logic is dispersed across\nfiles.\n  To address these challenges, we propose RepoLens, a novel approach that\nabstracts and leverages conceptual knowledge from code repositories. RepoLens\ndecomposes fine-grained functionalities and recomposes them into high-level\nconcerns, semantically coherent clusters of functionalities that guide LLMs. It\noperates in two stages: an offline stage that extracts and enriches conceptual\nknowledge into a repository-wide knowledge base, and an online stage that\nretrieves issue-specific terms, clusters and ranks concerns by relevance, and\nintegrates them into localization workflows via minimally intrusive prompt\nenhancements. We evaluate RepoLens on SWE-Lancer-Loc, a benchmark of 216 tasks\nderived from SWE-Lancer. RepoLens consistently improves three state-of-the-art\ntools, namely AgentLess, OpenHands, and mini-SWE-agent, achieving average gains\nof over 22% in Hit@k and 46% in Recall@k for file- and function-level\nlocalization.
