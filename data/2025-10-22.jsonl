Much current work has been focusing\non designing the test sample generators, ignoring the valuable knowledge about\ndata characteristics that can help guide the perturbation and hence limiting\ntheir full potential. In this paper, we seek to bridge such a gap by proposing\na generic framework of causally perturbed fairness testing, dubbed CausalFT.\nThrough causal inference, the key idea of CausalFT is to extract the most\ndirectly and causally relevant non-sensitive feature to its sensitive\ncounterpart, which can jointly influence the prediction of the label. Such a\ncausal relationship is then seamlessly injected into the perturbation to guide\na test sample generator. Unlike existing generator-level work, CausalFT serves\nas a higher-level framework that can be paired with diverse base generators.\nExtensive experiments on 1296 cases confirm that CausalFT can considerably\nimprove arbitrary base generators in revealing fairness bugs over 93% of the\ncases with acceptable extra runtime overhead. Compared with a state-of-the-art\napproach that ranks the non-sensitive features solely based on correlation,\nCausalFT performs significantly better on 64% cases while being much more\nefficient.
