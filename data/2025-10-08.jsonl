Existing combinatorial optimization\napproaches are static, ad hoc, and poorly suited to such non-stationary\nsettings. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that\nrecasts configuration allocation as a sequential decision-making problem. Our\nmethod is the first to integrate Q-learning with a hybrid reward design that\nfuses simulated outcomes and real-time feedback, enabling both sample\nefficiency and robustness. In addition, we develop an adaptive online-offline\ntraining scheme that allows the agent to quickly track abrupt probability\nshifts while maintaining long-run stability. Extensive simulation studies\ndemonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms static and\noptimization-based baselines, approaching oracle performance. This work\nestablishes RL as a powerful new paradigm for adaptive configuration\nallocation, advancing beyond traditional methods and offering broad\napplicability to dynamic testing and resource scheduling domains."}

These\nagents may deviate from user objectives, violate data handling policies, or be\ncompromised by adversarial attacks. Mitigating these dangers necessitates a\nmechanism to formally guarantee that an agent's actions adhere to predefined\nsafety constraints, a challenge that existing systems do not fully address. We\nintroduce VeriGuard, a novel framework that provides formal safety guarantees\nfor LLM-based agents through a dual-stage architecture designed for robust and\nverifiable correctness. The initial offline stage involves a comprehensive\nvalidation process. It begins by clarifying user intent to establish precise\nsafety specifications. VeriGuard then synthesizes a behavioral policy and\nsubjects it to both testing and formal verification to prove its compliance\nwith these specifications. This iterative process refines the policy until it\nis deemed correct. Subsequently, the second stage provides online action\nmonitoring, where VeriGuard operates as a runtime monitor to validate each\nproposed agent action against the pre-verified policy before execution. This\nseparation of the exhaustive offline validation from the lightweight online\nmonitoring allows formal guarantees to be practically applied, providing a\nrobust safeguard that substantially improves the trustworthiness of LLM agents."}

Using HR\ndata from 2016-2025 in Ericsson Sweden, we analyze how different work\nmodalities (onsite, remote, and hybrid) influence employee retention. Our\nfindings show a marked increase in resignations from summer 2021 to summer\n2023, especially among employees with less than five years of tenure. Employees\nonboarded remotely during the pandemic were significantly more likely to resign\nwithin their first three years, even after returning to the office. Exit\nsurveys suggest that remote onboarding may fail to establish the necessary\norganizational attachment, the feeling of belonging and long-term retention. By\ncontrast, the company's eventual successful return to pre-pandemic retention\nrates illustrates the value of differentiated work policies and supports\nreconsidering selective return-to-office (RTO) mandates. Our study demonstrates\nthe importance of employee integration practices in hybrid environments where\nthe requirement for in-office presence for recent hires shall be accompanied by\nin-office presence from their team members and more senior staff whose\nmentoring and social interactions contribute to integration into the corporate\nwork environment.
