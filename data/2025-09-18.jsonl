Ensuring these qualities is critical for scientific\nintegrity and discovery. This paper asks whether Research Software Science\n(RSS)--the empirical study of how research software is developed and\nused--should be considered a form of metascience, the science of science.\nClassification matters because it could affect recognition, funding, and\nintegration of RSS into research improvement. We define metascience and RSS,\ncompare their principles and objectives, and examine their overlaps. Arguments\nfor classification highlight shared commitments to reproducibility,\ntransparency, and empirical study of research processes. Arguments against\nportraying RSS as a specialized domain focused on a tool rather than the\nbroader scientific enterprise. Our analysis finds RSS advances core goals of\nmetascience, especially in computational reproducibility, and bridges\ntechnical, social, and cognitive aspects of research. Its classification\ndepends on whether one adopts a broad definition of metascience--any empirical\neffort to improve science--or a narrow one focused on systemic and\nepistemological structures. We argue RSS is best understood as a distinct\ninterdisciplinary domain that aligns with, and in some definitions fits within,\nmetascience. Recognizing it as such can strengthen its role in improving\nreliability, justify funding, and elevate software development in research\ninstitutions. Regardless of classification, applying scientific rigor to\nresearch software ensures the tools of discovery meet the standards of the\ndiscoveries themselves."}
