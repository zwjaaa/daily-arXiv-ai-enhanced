### [1] [Evolution of Kernels: Automated RISC-V Kernel Optimization with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14265)
*Siyuan Chen,Zhichao Lu,Qingfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EoK is an LLM-based evolutionary framework that automates kernel design for RISC-V by mining optimization ideas from established libraries and using RAG with domain-specific context, achieving 1.27x speedup over human experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated kernel design is needed for emerging hardware like RISC-V, but LLMs struggle in reference-scarce domains where comprehensive documentation and mature codebases are lacking.

Method: Evolution of Kernels (EoK) framework mines reusable optimization ideas from kernel libraries' development histories, formalizes them as design principles, and guides parallel LLM explorations using RAG with RISC-V-specific context to prioritize historically effective techniques.

Result: EoK achieves median 1.27x speedup, surpassing human experts on all 80 evaluated kernel design tasks and improving upon prior LLM-based methods by 20%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates viability of incorporating human experience into emerging domains and highlights significant potential for LLM-based automated kernel optimization in reference-scarce environments.

Abstract: Automated kernel design is critical for overcoming software ecosystem
barriers in emerging hardware platforms like RISC-V. While large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise for automated kernel optimization,
demonstrating success in CUDA domains with comprehensive technical documents
and mature codebases, their effectiveness remains unproven for reference-scarce
domains like RISC-V. We present Evolution of Kernels (EoK), a novel LLM-based
evolutionary program search framework that automates kernel design for domains
with limited reference material. EoK mitigates reference scarcity by mining and
formalizing reusable optimization ideas (general design principles + actionable
thoughts) from established kernel libraries' development histories; it then
guides parallel LLM explorations using these ideas, enriched via
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RISC-V-specific context, prioritizing
historically effective techniques. Empirically, EoK achieves a median 1.27x
speedup, surpassing human experts on all 80 evaluated kernel design tasks and
improving upon prior LLM-based automated kernel design methods by 20%. These
results underscore the viability of incorporating human experience into
emerging domains and highlight the immense potential of LLM-based automated
kernel optimization.

### [2] [Automated and Context-Aware Code Documentation Leveraging Advanced LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14273)
*Swapnil Sharma Sarker,Tanzina Taher Ifty*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper addresses automated Javadoc generation using LLMs, creates a novel context-aware dataset for modern Java codebases, and evaluates five open-source LLMs, finding LLaMA 3.1 as the most reliable performer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated documentation approaches focus on code summarization but lack template-based documentation generation (like Javadoc) using publicly available LLMs. Progress is hindered by the absence of Javadoc-specific datasets with modern language features and contextual information.

Method: Developed a novel context-aware dataset for Javadoc generation incorporating structural and semantic information from modern Java codebases. Evaluated five open-source LLMs (LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral, Qwen-2.5) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned setups.

Result: LLaMA 3.1 performed consistently well across different evaluation setups, demonstrating reliable performance for automated Javadoc generation.

Conclusion: LLaMA 3.1 offers a viable alternative to proprietary systems for practical, automated Javadoc generation, making it a reliable candidate for this task.

Abstract: Code documentation is essential to improve software maintainability and
comprehension. The tedious nature of manual code documentation has led to much
research on automated documentation generation. Existing automated approaches
primarily focused on code summarization, leaving a gap in template-based
documentation generation (e.g., Javadoc), particularly with publicly available
Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, progress in this area has been
hindered by the lack of a Javadoc-specific dataset that incorporates modern
language features, provides broad framework/library coverage, and includes
necessary contextual information. This study aims to address these gaps by
developing a tailored dataset and assessing the capabilities of publicly
available LLMs for context-aware, template-based Javadoc generation. In this
work, we present a novel, context-aware dataset for Javadoc generation that
includes critical structural and semantic information from modern Java
codebases. We evaluate five open-source LLMs (including LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2,
Phi-3, Mistral, Qwen-2.5) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned setups and
provide a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate
that LLaMA 3.1 performs consistently well and is a reliable candidate for
practical, automated Javadoc generation, offering a viable alternative to
proprietary systems.

### [3] [Towards Robust Agentic CUDA Kernel Benchmarking, Verification, and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14279)
*Robert Tjarko Lange,Qi Sun,Aaditya Prasad,Maxence Faldor,Yujin Tang,David Ha*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A new benchmark robust-kbench and agentic framework for rigorous evaluation and automated optimization of CUDA kernel generation using LLMs, outperforming torch implementations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM approaches focus on high-level software engineering solutions but neglect low-level CUDA kernel optimization, and current benchmarks have exploitable loopholes and lack diversity for proper generalization assessment.

Method: A comprehensive agentic framework that translates PyTorch code to CUDA kernels, then uses evolutionary meta-generation with LLM-based verifiers for iterative optimization and correctness checking within the robust-kbench evaluation setting.

Result: Produces CUDA kernels that outperform torch implementations for practical applications including forward/backward passes, enables operation fusion and various runtime optimizations, with verifiers accurately classifying incorrect kernels for efficient hardware verification.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses limitations in current kernel generation approaches by providing rigorous evaluation and automated optimization, demonstrating effective translation and improvement of CUDA kernel performance using frontier LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate their
effectiveness in scaling test-time compute for software engineering tasks.
However, these approaches often focus on high-level solutions, with limited
attention to optimizing low-level CUDA kernel implementations. Additionally,
existing kernel generation benchmarks suffer from exploitable loopholes and
insufficient diversity in testing conditions, hindering true generalization
assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce robust-kbench, a new
benchmark for rigorous evaluation of kernel performance and correctness across
varied scenarios. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive agentic framework
that automates CUDA kernel discovery, verification, and optimization. This
pipeline enables frontier LLMs to translate torch code to CUDA kernels and
iteratively improve their runtime within our robust evaluation setting. Our
sequential workflow first translates PyTorch code into equivalent CUDA kernels.
It then optimizes their runtime using a novel evolutionary meta-generation
procedure tailored to the CUDA ecosystem, guided by LLM-based verifiers for
correctness and efficient filtering. Evaluated on robust-kbench, our approach
produces CUDA kernels outperforming torch implementations for practical
applications, including forward and backward passes. It can fuse operations and
deploy various runtime optimization strategies. The verifier workflow
accurately classifies incorrect kernels, enhancing hardware verification
efficiency.

*Xifeng Yao,Dongyu Lang,Wu Zhang,Xintong Guo,Huarui Xie,Yinhao Ni,Ping Liu,Guang Shen,Yi Bai,Dandan Tu,Changzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A framework for synthesizing realistic code problems by extracting domain knowledge, skills, and coding skills from real-world datasets like Stack Overflow and Kaggle, then using a scenario-centric graph to generate diverse and complex coding challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advancements in code LLMs are constrained by scarcity of real-world coding problems. Need authentic problems that reflect practical challenges to further improve model capabilities.

Method: Extract domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills from programming datasets. Build scenario-centric graph connecting these elements. Use sampling strategy on graph to generate code problems with controlled complexity and diversity.

Result: Superior performance over state-of-the-art open-source LLMs of varying sizes and types (both coders and general-purpose models) across diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap in real-world coding problem availability, enabling better training and evaluation of code LLMs through authentic, diverse problem generation.

Abstract: Significant advancements have been made in the capabilities of code large
language models, leading to their rapid adoption and application across a wide
range of domains. However, their further advancements are often constrained by
the scarcity of real-world coding problems. To bridge this gap, we propose a
novel framework for synthesizing code problems that emulate authentic
real-world scenarios. This framework systematically integrates domain
knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills, all of which are meticulously
extracted from real-world programming-related datasets, including Stack
Overflow and Kaggle. The extracted elements serve as the foundational building
blocks for constructing code problems. To align the generated problems with
practical applications, application scenarios are also mined from the
aforementioned datasets. These scenarios are then utilized to construct a
scenario-centric graph that interconnects domain knowledge, domain skills, and
coding skills. Based on this structured representation, a sampling strategy on
the graph is designed, which effectively controls the generation of a code
problem with complexity and diversity, reflects real-world challenges.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art open-source large language models of
varying sizes and functionalities, including both coders and general-purpose
models, across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks.

### [6] [On the Illusion of Success: An Empirical Study of Build Reruns and Silent Failures in Industrial CI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14347)
*Henri Aïdasso,Francis Bordeleau,Ali Tizghadam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: First empirical study of silent failures in CI where jobs succeed but fail tasks, showing 11% of successful jobs are rerun with 35% delayed by 24+ hours, identifying key factors and 11 failure categories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers struggle with non-deterministic CI issues that undermine trust in build results. Silent failures (jobs marked successful but failing tasks) create illusion of success with detrimental consequences like production bugs.

Method: Analyzed 142,387 jobs across 81 industrial projects, used mixed-effects models on 32 variables (AUC 85%) to identify rerun factors, and examined 92 public issues to categorize silent failures.

Result: 11% of successful jobs are rerun, 35% after 24+ hours. Key factors: testing/static analysis tasks, Shell scripting, developer rerun tendencies. Identified 11 categories including artifact operation errors, caching errors, ignored exit codes.

Conclusion: Findings provide insights into silent failure circumstances and causes to raise team awareness, presenting solutions to improve CI reliability by addressing these hidden failure patterns.

Abstract: Reliability of build outcomes is a cornerstone of effective Continuous
Integration (CI). Yet in practice, developers often struggle with
non-deterministic issues in the code or CI infrastructure, which undermine
trust in build results. When faced with such unexpected outcomes, developers
often repeatedly rerun jobs hoping for true success, but this practice is known
to increase CI costs and reduce productivity. While recent studies have focused
on intermittent job failures, no prior work has investigated silent failures,
where build jobs are marked as successful but fail to complete all or part of
their tasks. Such silent failures often go unnoticed, creating an illusion of
success with detrimental consequences such as bugs escaping into production.
This paper presents the first empirical study of silent failures through the
practice of rerunning successful jobs. An analysis of 142,387 jobs across 81
industrial projects shows that 11% of successful jobs are rerun, with 35% of
these reruns occurring after more than 24 hours. Using mixed-effects models on
32 independent variables (AUC of 85%), we identified key factors associated
with reruns of successful jobs, notably testing and static analysis tasks,
scripting languages like Shell, and developers prior rerun tendencies. A
further analysis of 92 public issues revealed 11 categories of silent failures
aligning with these factors, the most frequent being artifact operation errors,
caching errors, and ignored exit codes. Overall, our findings provide valuable
insights into the circumstances and causes of silent failures to raise
awareness among teams, and present solutions to improve CI reliability.

### [8] [A Taxonomy of Prompt Defects in LLM Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14404)
*Haoye Tian,Chong Wang,BoYang Yang,Lyuye Zhang,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects in LLM programming, organized across 6 dimensions with mitigation strategies and engineering methodologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt design for LLMs remains empirical and error-prone, with small mistakes leading to unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior in LLM-driven software systems.

Method: Organizes prompt defects along six dimensions: Specification and Intent, Input and Content, Structure and Formatting, Context and Memory, Performance and Efficiency, and Maintainability and Engineering, with fine-grained subtypes, examples, and root cause analysis.

Result: Develops a comprehensive taxonomy of prompt defects with concrete examples, impact analysis, and mitigation strategies including prompt engineering patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks.

Conclusion: Calls for rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure LLM-driven systems are dependable by design, highlighting open research challenges in prompt reliability and security.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become key components of modern software,
with prompts acting as their de-facto programming interface. However, prompt
design remains largely empirical and small mistakes can cascade into
unreliable, insecure, or inefficient behavior. This paper presents the first
systematic survey and taxonomy of prompt defects, recurring ways that prompts
fail to elicit their intended behavior from LLMs. We organize defects along six
dimensions: (1) Specification and Intent, (2) Input and Content, (3) Structure
and Formatting, (4) Context and Memory, (5) Performance and Efficiency, and (6)
Maintainability and Engineering. Each dimension is refined into fine-grained
subtypes, illustrated with concrete examples and root cause analysis. Grounded
in software engineering principles, we show how these defects surface in real
development workflows and examine their downstream effects. For every subtype,
we distill mitigation strategies that span emerging prompt engineering
patterns, automated guardrails, testing harnesses, and evaluation frameworks.
We then summarize these strategies in a master taxonomy that links defect,
impact, and remedy. We conclude with open research challenges and a call for
rigorous engineering-oriented methodologies to ensure that LLM-driven systems
are dependable by design.

### [9] [An LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile effort estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14483)
*Thanh-Long Bui,Hoa Khanh Dam,Rashina Hoda*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile effort estimation that coordinates with human developers to reach consensus, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agile effort estimation practices rely on subjective assessments leading to inaccuracies, and existing ML methods lack explainability and human interaction capabilities.

Method: Proposed a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework that can produce estimates, coordinate, communicate, and discuss with human developers and other agents to reach consensus.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across all evaluation metrics on real-life dataset. Human study shows overwhelmingly positive experience from practitioners.

Conclusion: The LLM-based multi-agent framework successfully addresses the gap in explainable and interactive agile effort estimation, demonstrating superior performance and positive human collaboration experience.

Abstract: Effort estimation is a crucial activity in agile software development, where
teams collaboratively review, discuss, and estimate the effort required to
complete user stories in a product backlog. Current practices in agile effort
estimation heavily rely on subjective assessments, leading to inaccuracies and
inconsistencies in the estimates. While recent machine learning-based methods
show promising accuracy, they cannot explain or justify their estimates and
lack the capability to interact with human team members. Our paper fills this
significant gap by leveraging the powerful capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework for agile
estimation that not only can produce estimates, but also can coordinate,
communicate and discuss with human developers and other agents to reach a
consensus. Evaluation results on a real-life dataset show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across all evaluation metrics in the
majority of the cases. Our human study with software development practitioners
also demonstrates an overwhelmingly positive experience in collaborating with
our agents in agile effort estimation.

### [10] [Automating Modelica Module Generation Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Building Control Description Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14623)
*Hanlong Wan,Xing Lu,Yan Chen,Karthik Devaprasad,Laura Hinkle*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs can automate Modelica control module generation with 40-60% time savings, but current models struggle with zero-shot executable code and require human validation for simulation correctness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modelica control module development is labor-intensive and requires specialized expertise, creating a need for automated generation tools using large language models.

Method: Developed a structured workflow combining standardized prompt scaffolds, library-aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human-in-the-loop evaluation for four basic logic tasks and five control modules.

Result: GPT-4o failed in zero-shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to 83% success for control modules. Human repair needed 1-8 hours for failed outputs. LLM-assisted workflow reduced development time from 10-20 hours to 4-6 hours per module.

Conclusion: LLMs show potential for Modelica generation with significant time savings, but current limitations require future research in pre-simulation validation, stronger grounding, and closed-loop evaluation.

Abstract: Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to
design and test supervisory and fault tolerant strategies. Modelica is a widely
used equation based language, but developing control modules is labor intensive
and requires specialized expertise. This paper examines the use of large
language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of Control Description
Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed
a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library
aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop
evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or,
Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve
control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control).
The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in
zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic
logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success
rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair
(estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced
mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a
deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation
also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation
results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM
assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down
to 4 to 6 hours per module, corresponding to 40 to 60 percent time savings.
These results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LLM
assisted Modelica generation, and point to future research in pre simulation
validation, stronger grounding, and closed loop evaluation.

### [11] [Evaluating the Effectiveness of Coverage-Guided Fuzzing for Testing Deep Learning Library APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14626)
*Feiran Qin,M. M. Abid Naziri,Hengyu Ai,Saikat Dutta,Marcelo d'Amorim*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FlashFuzz is a coverage-guided fuzzing approach that uses LLMs to automatically synthesize API-level test harnesses for DL libraries, achieving significantly higher code coverage, bug detection, and efficiency compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches for finding bugs in DL libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow use API-level or model-level fuzzing without coverage guidance, limiting their effectiveness and efficiency. The paper investigates whether coverage-guided fuzzing can be effectively applied to DL libraries.

Method: FlashFuzz leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining templates, helper functions, and API documentation. It uses a feedback-driven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses for each API.

Result: FlashFuzz synthesized harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow APIs. It achieved 101.13-212.88% higher coverage, 1.0x-5.4x higher validity rate, and 1x-1182x speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods. It discovered 42 previously unknown bugs, with 8 already fixed.

Conclusion: The study confirms that coverage-guided fuzzing can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a strong baseline for future testing approaches, demonstrating significant improvements in coverage, bug detection, and scalability.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) libraries such as PyTorch provide the core components to
build major AI-enabled applications. Finding bugs in these libraries is
important and challenging. Prior approaches have tackled this by performing
either API-level fuzzing or model-level fuzzing, but they do not use coverage
guidance, which limits their effectiveness and efficiency. This raises an
intriguing question: can coverage guided fuzzing (CGF), in particular
frameworks like LibFuzzer, be effectively applied to DL libraries, and does it
offer meaningful improvements in code coverage, bug detection, and scalability
compared to prior methods?
  We present the first in-depth study to answer this question. A key challenge
in applying CGF to DL libraries is the need to create a test harness for each
API that can transform byte-level fuzzer inputs into valid API inputs. To
address this, we propose FlashFuzz, a technique that leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to automatically synthesize API-level harnesses by combining
templates, helper functions, and API documentation. FlashFuzz uses a feedback
driven strategy to iteratively synthesize and repair harnesses. With this
approach, FlashFuzz synthesizes harnesses for 1,151 PyTorch and 662 TensorFlow
APIs. Compared to state-of-the-art fuzzing methods (ACETest, PathFinder, and
TitanFuzz), FlashFuzz achieves up to 101.13 to 212.88 percent higher coverage
and 1.0x to 5.4x higher validity rate, while also delivering 1x to 1182x
speedups in input generation. FlashFuzz has discovered 42 previously unknown
bugs in PyTorch and TensorFlow, 8 of which are already fixed. Our study
confirms that CGF can be effectively applied to DL libraries and provides a
strong baseline for future testing approaches.

### [12] [SALT4Decompile: Inferring Source-level Abstract Logic Tree for LLM-Based Binary Decompilation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14646)
*Yongpan Wang,Xin Xu,Xiaojie Zhu,Xiaodong Gu,Beijun Shen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SALTM is a novel binary decompilation method that uses Source-level Abstract Logic Trees to guide LLMs in recovering high-level source code from assembly, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with 70.4% TCP rate and 10.6% improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based decompilation approaches treat assembly as linear sequences, overlooking jump patterns and data segments, which hinders accurate semantic recovery from binary code.

Method: SALTM constructs Source-level Abstract Logic Trees (SALT) from assembly to approximate high-level logic structure, fine-tunes LLMs using reconstructed SALT, and refines output through error correction and symbol recovery.

Result: Achieves 70.4% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with 10.6% improvement over SOTA, demonstrates robustness against obfuscation, and provides superior assistance to human analysts in real-world software.

Conclusion: SALTM effectively bridges the semantic gap between binary and source code by abstracting stable logical features, significantly advancing binary decompilation capabilities for reverse engineering.

Abstract: Decompilation is widely used in reverse engineering to recover high-level
language code from binary executables. While recent approaches leveraging Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising progress, they typically treat
assembly code as a linear sequence of instructions, overlooking arbitrary jump
patterns and isolated data segments inherent to binary files. This limitation
significantly hinders their ability to correctly infer source code semantics
from assembly code. To address this limitation, we propose \saltm, a novel
binary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared
between binary and source code. The core idea of \saltm is to abstract selected
binary-level operations, such as specific jumps, into a high-level logic
framework that better guides LLMs in semantic recovery. Given a binary
function, \saltm constructs a Source-level Abstract Logic Tree (\salt) from
assembly code to approximate the logic structure of high-level language. It
then fine-tunes an LLM using the reconstructed \salt to generate decompiled
code. Finally, the output is refined through error correction and symbol
recovery to improve readability and correctness. We compare \saltm to three
categories of baselines (general-purpose LLMs, commercial decompilers, and
decompilation methods) using three well-known datasets (Decompile-Eval, MBPP,
Exebench). Our experimental results demonstrate that \saltm is highly effective
in recovering the logic of the source code, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 70.4\% TCP rate on Decompile-Eval with a 10.6\%
improvement). The results further validate its robustness against four commonly
used obfuscation techniques. Additionally, analyses of real-world software and
a user study confirm that our decompiled output offers superior assistance to
human analysts in comprehending binary functions.

TL;DR: Analysis of 253 Claude.md agent manifest files reveals they typically have shallow hierarchies dominated by operational commands and technical notes, with limited comprehensive documentation available for developers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic coding tools use manifests (like Claude.md) to provide project context and operational rules, but developers face challenges due to lack of comprehensive documentation for creating these manifests.

Method: Analyzed 253 Claude.md files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content in agent manifests.

Result: Manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one main heading and several subsections, dominated by operational commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.

Conclusion: The study provides insights into current patterns of agent manifest structures, highlighting the need for better documentation standards to support developers in creating effective manifests for agentic coding tools.

Abstract: Agentic coding tools receive goals written in natural language as input,
break them down into specific tasks, and write/execute the actual code with
minimal human intervention. Key to this process are agent manifests,
configuration files (such as Claude.md) that provide agents with essential
project context, identity, and operational rules. However, the lack of
comprehensive and accessible documentation for creating these manifests
presents a significant challenge for developers. We analyzed 253 Claude.md
files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content.
Our findings show that manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one
main heading and several subsections, with content dominated by operational
commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.

*Miku Watanabe,Hao Li,Yutaro Kashiwa,Brittany Reid,Hajimu Iida,Ahmed E. Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Study of 567 AI-generated pull requests shows 83.8% acceptance rate with over half merged without changes, but human oversight remains valuable for bug fixes and project standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly generate code and submit pull requests autonomously, there's limited understanding of their practical usefulness and acceptance rates in real-world software projects.

Method: Empirical analysis of 567 GitHub pull requests generated using Claude Code across 157 diverse open-source projects, examining acceptance rates and modification requirements.

Result: 83.8% of agent-assisted PRs were accepted and merged, with 54.9% integrated without modification. The remaining 45.1% required human revisions, particularly for bug fixes, documentation, and project-specific standards.

Conclusion: AI-generated pull requests are largely acceptable but still benefit from human oversight and refinement, especially for complex tasks requiring project-specific knowledge and quality assurance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software
development processes. The ability to generate code and submit pull requests
with minimal human intervention, through the use of autonomous AI agents, is
poised to become a standard practice. However, little is known about the
practical usefulness of these pull requests and the extent to which their
contributions are accepted in real-world projects. In this paper, we
empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code,
an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis
reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring,
documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these
agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers,
with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The
remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions,
especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific
standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely
acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.

### [16] [RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829)
*Shuo Jin,Songqiang Chen,Xiaoyuan Xie,Shing-Chi Cheung*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RulER is a rule-based debugging method for code translation that automatically derives translation rules from LLM-generated correct translations to improve error localization and repair effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing automated debugging methods for code translation lack reliable references for code alignments and repair patch templates, which limits their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness.

Method: RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, dynamically combines rules on expandable nodes, and uses these rules as reliable references for code alignment and repair template design.

Result: RulER outperformed state-of-the-art methods (BatFix and TransMap) by 20% in error localization rates and 272% in repair success rates on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations.

Conclusion: RulER demonstrates superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs and shows promise for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs for code translation debugging.

Abstract: Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different
programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the
imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may
contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging
methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates
to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack
reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch
templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair
effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation
rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called
RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct
translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse
translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules
on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align
more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural
correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore,
they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and
repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors
effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++
translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental
results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms
of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER
exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for
patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and
leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.

*Hanyang Guo,Xunjin Zheng,Zihan Liao,Hang Yu,Peng DI,Ziyin Zhang,Hong-Ning Dai*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CodeFuse-CR-Bench is the first comprehensive benchmark for repository-level automated code review evaluation, addressing the reality gap in existing benchmarks by providing rich context and holistic assessment of LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks evaluate code review models on isolated sub-tasks with simplified, context-poor data, failing to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world code review processes.

Method: Created CodeFuse-CR-Bench with 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering 9 PR domains, each providing rich context including issues, PR details, and repository state. Proposed a novel evaluation framework combining rule-based checks for location/syntax with model-based quality judgments.

Result: First large-scale assessment shows: (1) no single LLM dominates all CR aspects; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves highest comprehensive performance; (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context.

Conclusion: Holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation is necessary for advancing practical code review assistants, and the benchmark provides crucial baselines and actionable insights for the field.

Abstract: Automated code review (CR) is a key application for Large Language Models
(LLMs), but progress is hampered by a "reality gap": existing benchmarks
evaluate models on isolated sub-tasks using simplified, context-poor data. This
fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge
this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware
benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601
high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR)
problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context
including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling
end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel
evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax
with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale
assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results
establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all
aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive
performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant
context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional
evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet
practical CR assistants.

### [18] [CARGO: A Framework for Confidence-Aware Routing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14899)
*Amine Barrak,Yosr Fourati,Michael Olchawa,Emna Ksontini,Khalil Zoghlami*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CARGO is a lightweight framework for routing user prompts to optimal LLMs using embedding-based predictions and optional binary classification for uncertain cases, achieving expert-level routing accuracy without human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs proliferate with varying scales, specializations, and latency profiles, there's a growing need for efficient routing systems that balance performance and cost when selecting the most appropriate model for user prompts.

Method: CARGO employs a single embedding-based regressor trained on LLM-judged pairwise comparisons to predict model performance, with an optional binary classifier for uncertain predictions. It supports category-specific regressors across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization, and creative writing.

Result: Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves 76.4% top-1 routing accuracy and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual experts.

Conclusion: Confidence-guided, lightweight routing like CARGO can achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a practical solution for real-world multi-model LLM deployments without requiring human-annotated supervision.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) proliferate in scale, specialization, and
latency profiles, the challenge of routing user prompts to the most appropriate
model has become increasingly critical for balancing performance and cost. We
introduce CARGO (Category-Aware Routing with Gap-based Optimization), a
lightweight, confidence-aware framework for dynamic LLM selection. CARGO
employs a single embedding-based regressor trained on LLM-judged pairwise
comparisons to predict model performance, with an optional binary classifier
invoked when predictions are uncertain. This two-stage design enables precise,
cost-aware routing without the need for human-annotated supervision. To capture
domain-specific behavior, CARGO also supports category-specific regressors
trained across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization,
and creative writing. Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5
Sonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing
accuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual
experts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing
can achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a
practical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Systematic review of Chaos Engineering adoption in industry, extending foundational principles into 10 concepts with emphasis on controlled experimentation, automation, and risk mitigation for DevOps environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate how industry practitioners have adopted and adapted Chaos Engineering principles in recent years, particularly within DevOps environments where system resilience is critical.

Method: Conducted a systematic gray literature review analyzing 50 sources published between 2019 and early 2024, developing a comprehensive classification framework.

Result: Extended foundational Chaos Engineering principles into ten distinct concepts, revealing practitioners' increased emphasis on controlled experimentation, automation, and risk mitigation strategies aligned with agile DevOps pipelines.

Conclusion: The study enhances understanding of Chaos Engineering implementation in practice and provides guidance for future research and industrial applications to improve system robustness in dynamic production environments.

Abstract: Chaos Engineering (CE) has emerged as a proactive method to improve the
resilience of modern distributed systems, particularly within DevOps
environments. Originally pioneered by Netflix, CE simulates real-world failures
to expose weaknesses before they impact production. In this paper, we present a
systematic gray literature review that investigates how industry practitioners
have adopted and adapted CE principles over recent years. Analyzing 50 sources
published between 2019 and early 2024, we developed a comprehensive
classification framework that extends the foundational CE principles into ten
distinct concepts. Our study reveals that while the core tenets of CE remain
influential, practitioners increasingly emphasize controlled experimentation,
automation, and risk mitigation strategies to align with the demands of agile
and continuously evolving DevOps pipelines. Our results enhance the
understanding of how CE is intended and implemented in practice, and offer
guidance for future research and industrial applications aimed at improving
system robustness in dynamic production environments.

### [20] [Code Less to Code More: Streamlining Language Server Protocol and Type System Development for Language Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15150)
*Federico Bruzzone,Walter Cazzola,Luca Favalli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Typelang framework reduces language editor support complexity from L×E to N×1 through modular type systems, automated language server generation, and cross-editor plugin automation, achieving 93.48% code reduction and 100% plugin automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and type system utilization for language server generation, making editing support development complex and time-consuming for multiple languages and editors.

Method: Proposes Typelang DSL family for modular type systems, modular language server generation process, variant-oriented programming paradigm with cross-artifact coordination, and automated LSP plugin generator for multiple editors.

Result: 93.48% reduction in characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in language families.

Conclusion: The approach successfully reduces language-editor combinations through modular reuse and automation, making editing support development more efficient, especially when language artifacts are reused across multiple languages.

Abstract: Developing editing support for $L$ languages in $E$ editors is complex and
time-consuming. Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others
offer a single native editor. The $\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP)
reduces the language-editor combinations $L \times E$ to $L + E$, where a
single language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However,
overlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing
language workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type
systems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang,
a family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable
type system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process,
producing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the
variant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer
to manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator,
reducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To
simplify editing support for language families, each language artifact
integrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This
reduces combinations to $T \times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of
type systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this
to $N \times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement
Typelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP
plugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in
characters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP
plugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in
language families, especially when artifacts are reused.

### [21] [Orion: Fuzzing Workflow Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15195)
*Max Bazalii,Marius Fleischer*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Orion is an automated fuzzing framework that uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, combined with traditional tools for verification, reducing human effort by 46-204x and discovering new vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern fuzz testing still requires substantial manual effort across workflow stages (codebase analysis, harness configuration, result triaging), with prior solutions only addressing individual stages rather than providing complete automation.

Method: Integrates LLM reasoning with traditional tools - uses LLMs for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools for verification, iterative refinement, and precision tasks.

Result: Reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on workflow stage, and discovered two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib library.

Conclusion: Orion successfully automates manual bottlenecks in fuzzing by combining LLM reasoning with traditional tools, enabling scalable fuzzing campaigns that were previously impractical with human effort alone.

Abstract: Fuzz testing is one of the most effective techniques for finding software
vulnerabilities. While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor
executions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to
configuring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual
effort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or
input minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a
complete fuzzing campaign.
  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of
fuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns
to scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs
for code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools
for verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision.
Across our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on
the workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery
of two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib
library.
