### [1] [E-Test: E'er-Improving Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19860)
*Ketai Qiu,Luca Di Grazia,Leonardo Mariani,Mauro Pezzè*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: E-Test is an approach that uses LLMs to identify untested execution scenarios from production data and generates test cases to enhance test suites, achieving better performance than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test suites are imperfect and finding new test cases that explore untested execution scenarios is challenging and labor-intensive, especially for large test suites over time.

Method: E-Test identifies untested executions from production scenarios and generates new test cases using Large Language Models (LLMs) to pinpoint scenarios not covered by current test suites.

Result: Evaluation on 1,975 scenarios from open-source Java projects shows E-Test achieves F1-score of 0.55, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches (max F1=0.34) and vanilla LLMs (max F1=0.39).

Conclusion: E-Test effectively enhances test suites by targeting untested execution scenarios and reduces manual effort for test suite maintenance.

Abstract: Test suites are inherently imperfect, and testers can always enrich a suite
with new test cases that improve its quality and, consequently, the reliability
of the target software system. However, finding test cases that explore
execution scenarios beyond the scope of an existing suite can be extremely
challenging and labor-intensive, particularly when managing large test suites
over extended periods.
  In this paper, we propose E-Test, an approach that reduces the gap between
the execution space explored with a test suite and the executions experienced
after testing by augmenting the test suite with test cases that explore
execution scenarios that emerge in production. E-Test (i) identifies executions
that have not yet been tested from large sets of scenarios, such as those
monitored during intensive production usage, and (ii) generates new test cases
that enhance the test suite. E-Test leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to
pinpoint scenarios that the current test suite does not adequately cover, and
augments the suite with test cases that execute these scenarios.
  Our evaluation on a dataset of 1,975 scenarios, collected from highly-starred
open-source Java projects already in production and Defects4J, demonstrates
that E-Test retrieves not-yet-tested execution scenarios significantly better
than state-of-the-art approaches. While existing regression testing and field
testing approaches for this task achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.34, and
vanilla LLMs achieve a maximum F1-score of 0.39, E-Test reaches 0.55. These
results highlight the impact of E-Test in enhancing test suites by effectively
targeting not-yet-tested execution scenarios and reducing manual effort
required for maintaining test suites.

### [2] [SODBench: A Large Language Model Approach to Documenting Spreadsheet Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19864)
*Amila Indika,Igor Molybog*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces Spreadsheet Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that generates human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations, and evaluates five LLMs on a benchmark of 111 spreadsheet code snippets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, risking loss of institutional knowledge.

Method: Created a benchmark of 111 spreadsheet manipulation code snippets with natural language summaries, then evaluated five LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, Gemma2-9B) using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR metrics.

Result: LLMs can generate accurate spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows.

Conclusion: SOD is a promising approach for spreadsheet documentation, though challenges remain that need to be addressed.

Abstract: Numerous knowledge workers utilize spreadsheets in business, accounting, and
finance. However, a lack of systematic documentation methods for spreadsheets
hinders automation, collaboration, and knowledge transfer, which risks the loss
of crucial institutional knowledge. This paper introduces Spreadsheet
Operations Documentation (SOD), an AI task that involves generating
human-readable explanations from spreadsheet operations. Many previous studies
have utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating spreadsheet
manipulation code; however, translating that code into natural language for SOD
is a less-explored area. To address this, we present a benchmark of 111
spreadsheet manipulation code snippets, each paired with a corresponding
natural language summary. We evaluate five LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini,
LLaMA-3.3-70B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemma2-9B, using BLEU, GLEU, ROUGE-L, and
METEOR metrics. Our findings suggest that LLMs can generate accurate
spreadsheet documentation, making SOD a feasible prerequisite step toward
enhancing reproducibility, maintainability, and collaborative workflows in
spreadsheets, although there are challenges that need to be addressed.

### [3] [Knowledge-Guided Multi-Agent Framework for Application-Level Software Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19868)
*Qian Xiong,Bo Yang,Weisong Sun,Yiran Zhang,Tianlin Li,Yang Liu,Zhi Jin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: KGACG is a knowledge-guided multi-agent framework for automated application-level code generation that transforms requirements and design documents into executable code through collaborative agents with feedback loops.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multi-agent frameworks perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software code generation, failing to ensure reasonable organizational structures and maintainable code generation processes.

Method: KGACG uses three collaborative agents (Code Organization & Planning Agent, Coding Agent, Testing Agent) with feedback mechanisms to transform software requirements and architectural design into executable code.

Result: Demonstrated through a Java Tank Battle game case study, showing the collaborative process of agents while facing challenges in application-level code generation.

Conclusion: KGACG advances the automation of application-level software development by providing a structured multi-agent approach with knowledge guidance and feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: Automated code generation driven by Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) has
enhanced development efficiency, yet generating complex application-level
software code remains challenging. Multi-agent frameworks show potential, but
existing methods perform inadequately in large-scale application-level software
code generation, failing to ensure reasonable orga- nizational structures of
project code and making it difficult to maintain the code generation process.
To address this, this paper envisions a Knowledge-Guided Application-Level Code
Generation framework named KGACG, which aims to trans- form software
requirements specification and architectural design document into executable
code through a collaborative closed- loop of the Code Organization & Planning
Agent (COPA), Coding Agent (CA), and Testing Agent (TA), combined with a
feedback mechanism. We demonstrate the collaborative process of the agents in
KGACG in a Java Tank Battle game case study while facing challenges. KGACG is
dedicated to advancing the automation of application-level software
development.

### [4] [BugPilot: Complex Bug Generation for Efficient Learning of SWE Skills](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19898)
*Atharv Sonwane,Isadora White,Hyunji Lee,Matheus Pereira,Lucas Caccia,Minseon Kim,Zhengyan Shi,Chinmay Singh,Alessandro Sordoni,Marc-Alexandre Côté,Xingdi Yuan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A novel method for generating realistic software bugs by having SWE agents introduce features that unintentionally break tests, producing more realistic training data than intentional bug injection methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High quality bugs are essential for training effective language model-based software engineering agents, but current methods generate unrealistic bugs through intentional perturbations rather than reflecting real development processes.

Method: Instruct SWE agents to introduce features into codebases where they may unintentionally break tests, creating bugs that more closely resemble human-authored edits through natural development workflows.

Result: The generated bugs provide more efficient training data, outperforming other datasets by 2% with only half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k bugs). FrogBoss (32B) achieved 54.6% pass@1 and FrogMini (14B) achieved 45.3% pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified.

Conclusion: The approach generates more realistic bugs that lead to state-of-the-art performance in software engineering agents, demonstrating the importance of realistic bug generation methods for effective model training.

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over
three seeds.

### [5] [On Interaction Effects in Greybox Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19984)
*Konstantinos Kitsios,Marcel Böhme,Alberto Bacchelli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MuoFuzz is a greybox fuzzer that learns optimal mutator sequences by modeling conditional probabilities between mutators, achieving higher code coverage and bug detection than existing fuzzers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The authors hypothesize that the order in which mutators are applied to seed inputs significantly impacts greybox fuzzer effectiveness, suggesting current approaches that use fixed or isolated mutator selection are suboptimal.

Method: MuoFuzz learns conditional probabilities that the next mutator will yield interesting inputs given the previous mutator, then samples from these probabilities using random walks to generate mutator sequences.

Result: MuoFuzz achieves the highest code coverage on FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks, finding four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and MOPT.

Conclusion: Learning and applying optimal mutator sequences significantly improves greybox fuzzing effectiveness compared to fixed or isolated mutator selection approaches.

Abstract: A greybox fuzzer is an automated software testing tool that generates new
test inputs by applying randomly chosen mutators (e.g., flipping a bit or
deleting a block of bytes) to a seed input in random order and adds all
coverage-increasing inputs to the corpus of seeds. We hypothesize that the
order in which mutators are applied to a seed input has an impact on the
effectiveness of greybox fuzzers. In our experiments, we fit a linear model to
a dataset that contains the effectiveness of all possible mutator pairs and
indeed observe the conjectured interaction effect. This points us to more
efficient fuzzing by choosing the most promising mutator sequence with a higher
likelihood. We propose MuoFuzz, a greybox fuzzer that learns and chooses the
most promising mutator sequences. MuoFuzz learns the conditional probability
that the next mutator will yield an interesting input, given the previously
selected mutator. Then, it samples from the learned probability using a random
walk to generate mutator sequences. We compare the performance of MuoFuzz to
AFL++, which uses a fixed selection probability, and MOPT, which optimizes the
selection probability of each mutator in isolation. Experimental results on the
FuzzBench and MAGMA benchmarks show that MuoFuzz achieves the highest code
coverage and finds four bugs missed by AFL++ and one missed by both AFL++ and
MOPT.

### [6] [A Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises (FAIGMOE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19997)
*Abraham Itzhak Weinberg*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FAIGMOE is a conceptual framework for GenAI adoption that addresses the unique challenges of midsize organizations (resource constraints) and enterprises (organizational complexity), filling a gap in existing technology adoption models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing technology adoption frameworks (TAM, TOE, DOI) lack specificity for GenAI implementation across different organizational contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature.

Method: FAIGMOE synthesizes technology adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and Operationalization and Optimization.

Result: The framework provides scalable guidance on readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical architecture, and change management, incorporating GenAI-specific considerations like prompt engineering and hallucination management.

Conclusion: FAIGMOE offers the first comprehensive conceptual framework for GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise organizations, providing actionable implementation protocols and governance templates that require future empirical validation.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents transformative
opportunities for organizations, yet both midsize organizations and larger
enterprises face distinctive adoption challenges. Midsize organizations
encounter resource constraints and limited AI expertise, while enterprises
struggle with organizational complexity and coordination challenges. Existing
technology adoption frameworks, including TAM (Technology Acceptance Model),
TOE (Technology Organization Environment), and DOI (Diffusion of Innovations)
theory, lack the specificity required for GenAI implementation across these
diverse contexts, creating a critical gap in adoption literature. This paper
introduces FAIGMOE (Framework for the Adoption and Integration of Generative AI
in Midsize Organizations and Enterprises), a conceptual framework addressing
the unique needs of both organizational types. FAIGMOE synthesizes technology
adoption theory, organizational change management, and innovation diffusion
perspectives into four interconnected phases: Strategic Assessment, Planning
and Use Case Development, Implementation and Integration, and
Operationalization and Optimization. Each phase provides scalable guidance on
readiness assessment, strategic alignment, risk governance, technical
architecture, and change management adaptable to organizational scale and
complexity. The framework incorporates GenAI specific considerations including
prompt engineering, model orchestration, and hallucination management that
distinguish it from generic technology adoption frameworks. As a perspective
contribution, FAIGMOE provides the first comprehensive conceptual framework
explicitly addressing GenAI adoption across midsize and enterprise
organizations, offering actionable implementation protocols, assessment
instruments, and governance templates requiring empirical validation through
future research.

### [7] [The Cost of Downgrading Build Systems: A Case Study of Kubernetes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20041)
*Gareema Ranjan,Mahmoud Alfadel,Gengyi Sun,Shane McIntosh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Downgrading from artifact-based build tools like Bazel to language-specific alternatives incurs significant performance costs despite perceived maintainability benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the implications of build tool downgrades, particularly why teams abandon faster artifact-based tools for easier-to-maintain alternatives and what performance costs this entails.

Method: Case study of Kubernetes project's downgrade from Bazel to Go Build, reproducing and analyzing full/incremental builds during downgrade period, then replicating study on four other projects that downgraded from Bazel.

Result: Bazel builds are faster (23.06-38.66s vs 75.19s for full builds) but consume more memory (81.42-351.07MB) and impose greater CPU load at higher parallelism. Downgrading increases CI resource costs by up to 76%. Similar patterns observed in other projects.

Conclusion: Abandoning artifact-based build tools tends to incur considerable performance costs for large projects, highlighting the need to balance maintainability benefits against performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Since developers invoke the build system frequently, its performance can
impact productivity. Modern artifact-based build tools accelerate builds, yet
prior work shows that teams may abandon them for alternatives that are easier
to maintain. While prior work shows why downgrades are performed, the
implications of downgrades remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
describe a case study of the Kubernetes project, focusing on its downgrade from
an artifact-based build tool (Bazel) to a language-specific solution (Go
Build). We reproduce and analyze the full and incremental builds of change sets
during the downgrade period. On the one hand, we find that Bazel builds are
faster than Go Build, completing full builds in 23.06-38.66 up to 75.19 impose
a larger memory footprint than Go Build of 81.42-351.07 respectively. Bazel
builds also impose a greater CPU load at parallelism settings above eight for
full builds and above one for incremental builds. We estimate that downgrading
from Bazel can increase CI resource costs by up to 76 explore whether our
observations generalize by replicating our Kubernetes study on four other
projects that also downgraded from Bazel to older build tools. We observe that
while build time penalties decrease, Bazel consistently consumes more memory.
We conclude that abandoning artifact-based build tools, despite perceived
maintainability benefits, tends to incur considerable performance costs for
large projects. Our observations may help stakeholders to balance trade-offs in
build tool adoption

### [8] [Developing a Model-Driven Reengineering Approach for Migrating PL/SQL Triggers to Java: A Practical Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20121)
*Carlos J. Fernandez-Candel,Jesus Garcia-Molina,Francisco Javier Bermudez Ruiz,Jose Ramon Hoyos Barcelo,Diego Sevilla Ruiz,Benito Jose Cuesta Viera*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A model-driven reengineering process for migrating PL/SQL monolithic code from Oracle Forms to Java using KDM models and TDD-like approach with three validation types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the migration needs of enterprises moving from RAD platforms like Oracle Forms to modern technologies, specifically converting PL/SQL code to Java.

Method: Model-driven reengineering using KDM models to represent legacy code, with TDD-like approach for incremental development of model transformations and three types of validations for generated code.

Result: Development of a migration tool that successfully converts PL/SQL code from Forms triggers and program units to Java code separated in multiple tiers.

Conclusion: Model-driven engineering techniques can be effectively applied to reengineering scenarios, providing a systematic approach for migrating legacy RAD applications to modern technologies.

Abstract: Model-driven software engineering (MDE) techniques are not only useful in
forward engineering scenarios, but can also be successfully applied to evolve
existing systems. RAD (Rapid Application Development) platforms emerged in the
nineties, but the success of modern software technologies motivated that a
large number of enterprises tackled the migration of their RAD applications,
such as Oracle Forms. Our research group has collaborated with a software
company in developing a solution to migrate PL/SQL monolithic code on Forms
triggers and program units to Java code separated in several tiers.
  Our research focused on the model-driven reengineering process applied to
develop the migration tool for the conversion of PL/SQL code to Java. Legacy
code is represented in form of KDM (Knowledge-Discovery Metamodel) models. In
this paper, we propose a software process to implement a model-driven
re-engineering. This process integrates a TDD-like approach to incrementally
develop model transformations with three kinds of validations for the generated
code. The implementation and validation of the re-engineering approach are
explained in detail, as well as the evaluation of some issues related with the
application of MDE.

### [9] [Automated Cloud Infrastructure-as-Code Reconciliation with AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20211)
*Zhenning Yang,Hui Guan,Victor Nicolet,Brandon Paulsen,Joey Dodds,Daniel Kroening,Ang Chen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NSync is an automated system that reconciles infrastructure drift in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) by detecting non-IaC changes from cloud API traces and updating IaC configurations to capture those changes, using LLMs to infer intents and synthesize updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When IaC frameworks are used alongside traditional cloud management tools (consoles, CLIs, SDKs), they lose visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure drift where configurations become outdated and subsequent IaC operations may undo valid updates or trigger errors.

Method: NSync uses an agentic architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past reconciliations. It detects drift from cloud API traces and reconciles it by updating IaC configurations.

Result: Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372 drift scenarios show NSync outperforms the baseline in accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47× improvement).

Conclusion: NSync effectively addresses infrastructure drift in IaC environments by automatically detecting and reconciling out-of-band changes through API trace analysis and LLM-powered intent inference, significantly improving reconciliation accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Cloud infrastructure is managed through a mix of interfaces -- traditionally,
cloud consoles, command-line interfaces (CLI), and SDKs are the tools of
choice. Recently, Infrastructure-as-Code/IaC frameworks (e.g., Terraform) have
quickly gained popularity. Unlike conventional tools, IaC~frameworks encode the
infrastructure in a "source-of-truth" configuration. They are capable of
automatically carrying out modifications to the cloud -- deploying, updating,
or destroying resources -- to bring the actual infrastructure into alignment
with the IaC configuration. However, when IaC is used alongside consoles, CLIs,
or SDKs, it loses visibility into external changes, causing infrastructure
drift, where the configuration becomes outdated, and later IaC operations may
undo valid updates or trigger errors.
  We present NSync, an automated system for IaC reconciliation that propagates
out-of-band changes back into the IaC program. Our key insight is that
infrastructure changes eventually all occur via cloud API invocations -- the
lowest layer for cloud management operations. NSync gleans insights from API
traces to detect drift (i.e., non-IaC changes) and reconcile it (i.e., update
the IaC configuration to capture the changes). It employs an agentic
architecture that leverages LLMs to infer high-level intents from noisy API
sequences, synthesize targeted IaC updates using specialized tools, and
continually improve through a self-evolving knowledge base of past
reconciliations. We further introduce a novel evaluation pipeline for injecting
realistic drifts into cloud infrastructure and assessing reconciliation
performance. Experiments across five real-world Terraform projects and 372
drift scenarios show that NSync outperforms the baseline both in terms of
accuracy (from 0.71 to 0.97 pass@3) and token efficiency (1.47$\times$
improvement).

*Serena Cofano,Daniel Williams,Aman Sharma,Martin Monperrus*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Classport enables runtime introspection of Java dependencies by embedding dependency information into class files, allowing identification of used dependencies during program execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Java lacks support for runtime dependency introspection, which is fundamental for Software Supply Chain security.

Method: Classport embeds dependency information directly into Java class files, enabling retrieval of dependency information at runtime.

Result: Evaluation on six real-world projects demonstrates feasibility in identifying dependencies at runtime.

Conclusion: Runtime dependency introspection with Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

Abstract: Runtime introspection of dependencies, i.e., the ability to observe which
dependencies are currently used during program execution, is fundamental for
Software Supply Chain security. Yet, Java has no support for it. We solve this
problem with Classport, a system that embeds dependency information into Java
class files, enabling the retrieval of dependency information at runtime. We
evaluate Classport on six real-world projects, demonstrating the feasibility in
identifying dependencies at runtime. Runtime dependency introspection with
Classport opens important avenues for runtime integrity checking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore how architectural robustness in software platforms emerges from enforcing structural regularities and symmetries.

Method: Analyzing software platforms as structure preserving systems that maintain consistent interfaces and behaviors under specific transformations.

Result: The paper demonstrates that architectural robustness is achieved through the enforcement of structural regularities and symmetries in software platforms.

Conclusion: Enforcing structural regularities and symmetries in software platforms leads to architectural robustness, making them more reliable and maintainable.

Abstract: Software platforms often act as structure preserving systems. They provide
consistent interfaces and behaviors that remain stable under specific
transformations that we denote as symmetries. This paper explores the idea that
architectural robustness emerges from enforcing such structural regularities

*Santiago Gil,Ecem E. Baş,Christian D. Jensen,Sebastian Engelsgaard,Giuseppe Abbiati,Cláudio Gomes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes a distributed co-simulation approach using UniFMU with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection, ensuring client-initiated connections and trusted platform model storage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributed co-simulation enables collaborative modeling while protecting IP, but lacks consensus on cybersecurity guidelines for continuous-time/hybrid systems against hacking attacks.

Method: Developed approach using UniFMU with enhanced cybersecurity mechanisms, client-initiated connections, and trusted platform model storage. Tested with two co-simulation demos in four network settings.

Result: Successfully demonstrated functionality in various network configurations and analyzed trade-offs between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection for distributed co-simulation while maintaining functionality across different network environments.

Abstract: Distributed co-simulation plays a key role in enabling collaborative modeling
and simulation by different stakeholders while protecting their Intellectual
Property (IP). Although IP protection is provided implicitly by co-simulation,
there is no consensus in the guidelines to conduct distributed co-simulation of
continuous-time or hybrid systems with no exposure to potential hacking
attacks. We propose an approach for distributed co-simulation on top of UniFMU
with enhanced cybersecurity and IP protection mechanisms, ensuring that the
connection is initiated by the client and the models and binaries live on
trusted platforms. We showcase the functionality of this approach using two
co-simulation demos in four different network settings and analyze the
trade-off between IP-protected distribution and performance efficiency in these
settings.

*Lea Salome Brugger,Xavier Denis,Peter Müller*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Study identifies barriers and enablers for deductive verification adoption through interviews with 30 practitioners, revealing challenges like proof maintenance and automation control, and providing recommendations for different stakeholders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite proven usefulness, deductive verification is not mainstream. The study aims to understand factors enabling successful applications and issues preventing broader adoption.

Method: Conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 verification practitioners from industry and academia, followed by systematic thematic analysis of collected data.

Result: Confirmed known challenges (e.g., high expertise requirements) and revealed underexplored obstacles like proof maintenance, insufficient automation control, and usability concerns.

Conclusion: Extracted enablers and barriers for deductive verification, formulated concrete recommendations for practitioners, tool builders, and researchers regarding usability, automation, and workflow integration principles.

Abstract: Deductive verification is an effective method to ensure that a given system
exposes the intended behavior. In spite of its proven usefulness and
feasibility in selected projects, deductive verification is still not a
mainstream technique. To pave the way to widespread use, we present a study
investigating the factors enabling successful applications of deductive
verification and the underlying issues preventing broader adoption. We
conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 practitioners of verification from
both industry and academia and systematically analyzed the collected data
employing a thematic analysis approach. Beside empirically confirming familiar
challenges, e.g., the high level of expertise needed for conducting formal
proofs, our data reveal several underexplored obstacles, such as proof
maintenance, insufficient control over automation, and usability concerns. We
further use the results from our data analysis to extract enablers and barriers
for deductive verification and formulate concrete recommendations for
practitioners, tool builders, and researchers, including principles for
usability, automation, and integration with existing workflows.

### [14] [Large Language Models for Fault Localization: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20521)
*YingJian Xiao,RongQun Hu,WeiWei Gong,HongWei Li,AnQuan Jie*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Systematic evaluation of LLMs for statement-level code fault localization, testing open-source and closed-source models on HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets with various prompting strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs show strong code repair capabilities but their effectiveness depends on upstream fault localization, which lacks comprehensive evaluation. This study addresses this gap.

Method: Evaluated Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4.1 mini, and Gemini-2.5-flash on fault localization using standard prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning strategies.

Result: Bug report context significantly improves performance. Few-shot learning shows diminishing returns, and chain-of-thought effectiveness depends on model's reasoning capabilities. Performance varies across accuracy, time efficiency, and cost dimensions.

Conclusion: Study reveals performance characteristics and trade-offs of different LLMs in fault localization, providing insights for improving fault localization effectiveness and highlighting current LLM strengths.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
code-related tasks, particularly in automated program repair. However, the
effectiveness of such repairs is highly dependent on the performance of
upstream fault localization, for which comprehensive evaluations are currently
lacking. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on LLMs in the
statement-level code fault localization task. We evaluate representative
open-source models (Qwen2.5-coder-32b-instruct, DeepSeek-V3) and closed-source
models (GPT-4.1 mini, Gemini-2.5-flash) to assess their fault localization
capabilities on the HumanEval-Java and Defects4J datasets. The study
investigates the impact of different prompting strategies--including standard
prompts, few-shot examples, and chain-of-reasoning--on model performance, with
a focus on analysis across accuracy, time efficiency, and economic cost
dimensions. Our experimental results show that incorporating bug report context
significantly enhances model performance. Few-shot learning shows potential for
improvement but exhibits noticeable diminishing marginal returns, while
chain-of-thought reasoning's effectiveness is highly contingent on the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. This study not only highlights the performance
characteristics and trade-offs of different models in fault localization tasks,
but also offers valuable insights into the strengths of current LLMs and
strategies for improving fault localization effectiveness.

### [15] [A Soundness and Precision Benchmark for Java Debloating Tools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20679)
*Jonas Klauke,Tom Ohlmer,Stefan Schott,Serena Elisa Ponta,Wolfram Fischer,Eric Bodden*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Deblometer is a micro-benchmark with 59 test cases to evaluate Java debloating tools' soundness and precision. Evaluation of Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard reveals all tools remove required constructs, with dynamic class loading causing unsoundness across all tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern software has excessive dependencies (avg 36 per project, 80% transitive), with only 24.9% required at runtime. Many unused program constructs add unnecessary code, creating need for debloating tools that balance precision and soundness.

Method: Developed Deblometer - a micro-benchmark with 59 test cases covering Java language features. Each test case has manually curated ground truth specifying necessary vs bloated classes, methods, and fields to measure soundness and precision.

Result: All three tools (Deptrim, JShrink, ProGuard) remove required program constructs, causing changed semantics or execution crashes. Dynamic class loading introduces unsoundness in all tools. Deptrim retains more bloated constructs, ProGuard removes more required constructs, JShrink has annotation support issues.

Conclusion: Current debloating tools have significant soundness issues, especially with dynamic class loading and annotations. There's a need to improve these tools to ensure stable and reliable debloated software.

Abstract: Modern software development reuses code by importing libraries as
dependencies. Software projects typically include an average of 36
dependencies, with 80% being transitive, meaning they are dependencies of
dependencies. Recent research indicates that only 24.9% of these dependencies
are required at runtime, and even within those, many program constructs remain
unused, adding unnecessary code to the project. This has led to the development
of debloating tools that remove unnecessary dependencies and program constructs
while balancing precision by eliminating unused constructs and soundness by
preserving all required constructs. To systematically evaluate this trade-off,
we developed Deblometer, a micro-benchmark consisting of 59 test cases designed
to assess support for various Java language features in debloating tools. Each
test case includes a manually curated ground truth specifying necessary and
bloated classes, methods, and fields, enabling precise measurement of soundness
and precision. Using Deblometer, we evaluated three popular Java debloating
tools: Deptrim, JShrink, and ProGuard. Our evaluation reveals that all tools
remove required program constructs, which results in changed semantics or
execution crashes. In particular, the dynamic class loading feature introduces
unsoundness in all evaluated tools. Our comparison shows that Deptrim retains
more bloated constructs, while ProGuard removes more required constructs.
JShrink's soundness is significantly affected by limited support for
annotations, which leads to corrupted debloated artifacts. These soundness
issues highlight the need to improve debloating tools to ensure stable and
reliable debloated software.

Motivation: Cloud computing's growing use requires complex access control policies that are error-prone to write manually and difficult to analyze. LLMs' success in code tasks suggests potential for automating policy generation and analysis.

Method: Investigated LLMs for policy synthesis and introduced semantic-based request summarization using LLMs to characterize allowed requests. Compared reasoning vs non-reasoning LLMs for policy generation accuracy.

Result: LLMs generate syntactically correct policies but have permissiveness issues: 45.8% accuracy for non-reasoning LLMs vs 93.7% for reasoning LLMs. LLMs show promise when combined with symbolic approaches for policy analysis.

Conclusion: LLMs face significant hurdles for automated policy generation but demonstrate promising results for policy analysis when integrated with symbolic methods, particularly for understanding existing policies.

Abstract: Cloud computing is ubiquitous, with a growing number of services being hosted
on the cloud every day. Typical cloud compute systems allow administrators to
write policies implementing access control rules which specify how access to
private data is governed. These policies must be manually written, and due to
their complexity can often be error prone. Moreover, existing policies often
implement complex access control specifications and thus can be difficult to
precisely analyze in determining their behavior works exactly as intended.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great success in automated
code synthesis and summarization. Given this success, they could potentially be
used for automatically generating access control policies or aid in
understanding existing policies. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of
LLMs for access control policy synthesis and summarization. Specifically, we
first investigate diverse LLMs for access control policy synthesis, finding
that: although LLMs can effectively generate syntactically correct policies,
they have permissiveness issues, generating policies equivalent to the given
specification 45.8% of the time for non-reasoning LLMs, and 93.7% of the time
for reasoning LLMs. We then investigate how LLMs can be used to analyze
policies by introducing a novel semantic-based request summarization approach
which leverages LLMs to generate a precise characterization of the requests
allowed by a policy. Our results show that while there are significant hurdles
in leveraging LLMs for automated policy generation, LLMs show promising results
when combined with symbolic approaches in analyzing existing policies.
