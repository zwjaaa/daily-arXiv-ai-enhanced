To address this limitation, we propose \\saltm, a novel\nbinary decompilation method that abstracts stable logical features shared\nbetween binary and source code.

To capture\ndomain-specific behavior, CARGO also supports category-specific regressors\ntrained across five task groups: mathematics, coding, reasoning, summarization,\nand creative writing. Evaluated on four competitive LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5\nSonnet, DeepSeek V3, and Perplexity Sonar), CARGO achieves a top-1 routing\naccuracy of 76.4% and win rates ranging from 72% to 89% against individual\nexperts. These results demonstrate that confidence-guided, lightweight routing\ncan achieve expert-level performance with minimal overhead, offering a\npractical solution for real-world, multi-model LLM deployments."}

Originally pioneered by Netflix, CE simulates real-world failures\nto expose weaknesses before they impact production. In this paper, we present a\nsystematic gray literature review that investigates how industry practitioners\nhave adopted and adapted CE principles over recent years. Analyzing 50 sources\npublished between 2019 and early 2024, we developed a comprehensive\nclassification framework that extends the foundational CE principles into ten\ndistinct concepts. Our study reveals that while the core tenets of CE remain\ninfluential, practitioners increasingly emphasize controlled experimentation,\nautomation, and risk mitigation strategies to align with the demands of agile\nand continuously evolving DevOps pipelines. Our results enhance the\nunderstanding of how CE is intended and implemented in practice, and offer\nguidance for future research and industrial applications aimed at improving\nsystem robustness in dynamic production environments."}

Some languages do not provide dedicated editors, while others\noffer a single native editor. The $\\textit{language server protocol}$ (LSP)\nreduces the language-editor combinations $L \\times E$ to $L + E$, where a\nsingle language server communicates with editors via LSP plugins. However,\noverlapping implementations of linguistic components remain an issue. Existing\nlanguage workbenches struggle with modularity, reusability, and leveraging type\nsystems for language server generation. In this work, we propose: (i) Typelang,\na family of domain-specific languages for modular, composable, and reusable\ntype system implementation, (ii) a modular language server generation process,\nproducing servers for languages built in a modular workbench, (iii) the\nvariant-oriented programming paradigm and a cross-artifact coordination layer\nto manage interdependent software variants, and (iv) an LSP plugin generator,\nreducing $E$ to $1$ by automating plugin creation for multiple editors. To\nsimplify editing support for language families, each language artifact\nintegrates its own Typelang variant, used to generate language servers. This\nreduces combinations to $T \\times 1$, where $T = L$ represents the number of\ntype systems. Further reuse of language artifacts across languages lowers this\nto $N \\times 1$, where $N << T$, representing unique type systems. We implement\nTypelang in Neverlang, generating language servers for each artifact and LSP\nplugins for three editors. Empirical evaluation shows a 93.48% reduction in\ncharacters needed for type system implementation and 100% automation of LSP\nplugin generation, significantly lowering effort for editing support in\nlanguage families, especially when artifacts are reused."}

While modern fuzzers can generate inputs and monitor\nexecutions automatically, the overall workflow, from analyzing a codebase, to\nconfiguring harnesses, to triaging results, still requires substantial manual\neffort. Prior attempts focused on single stages such as harness synthesis or\ninput minimization, leaving researchers to manually connect the pieces into a\ncomplete fuzzing campaign.\n  We introduce Orion, a framework that automates the the manual bottlenecks of\nfuzzing by integrating LLM reasoning with traditional tools, allowing campaigns\nto scale to settings where human effort alone was impractical. Orion uses LLMs\nfor code reasoning and semantic guidance, while relying on deterministic tools\nfor verification, iterative refinement, and tasks that require precision.\nAcross our benchmark suite, Orion reduces human effort by 46-204x depending on\nthe workflow stage, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through the discovery\nof two previously unknown vulnerabilities in the widely used open-source clib\nlibrary."}
