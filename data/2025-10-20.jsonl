Recent\ndevelopments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities\nin code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training\nmodels for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into\nprogram-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has\ncomplete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not\nprovide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length,\nwhile the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due\nto limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods\nfor code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In\nthis paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to\ngenerate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we\nexplore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently\nenhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data.\nExperiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined\nwith the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the\nbaseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k."}

This enables CES to rule out\nsuspiciously correct output predictions due to reasoning shortcuts,\nhallucinations, or potential data leakage. CES also introduces a novel metric\nto measure reasoning consistency across tests with the same or different prime\npath coverage in a spectrum: strong, weak, and random. Evaluating 16 LLMs\n(including three reasoning LLMs) using CES indicates 81.42% coherent execution\nsimulation on HumanEval, 46.92% and 53.08% of which result in correct and\nincorrect output predictions. Frontier LLMs such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-R1 have\nthe most incoherent execution reasoning, mostly due to natural language\nshortcuts. Despite relatively coherent execution simulation, LLMs' reasoning\nperformance across different tests is inconsistent, mostly random (48.87%) or\nweak (45.37%), potentially explaining their weakness in programming tasks that\nrequire path-sensitive program analysis to succeed. We also compare CES with\nbug prediction/localization/repair, which intuitively requires control- and\ndata-flow awareness. We observe that LLMs barely incorporate execution\nreasoning into their analysis for bug-related tasks, and their success is\nprimarily due to inherent abilities in pattern matching or natural language\nshortcuts, if not data leakage. Without reasoning, there is a threat to the\ngeneralizability of LLMs in dealing with unseen bugs or patterns in different\ncontexts. CES can be used to vet the suspicious success of LLMs in these tasks\nsystematically."}

Methods: We analyzed 33,946 GitHub repositories,\ndefining and operationalizing CE with validated per-month metrics (issues,\ncomments, watchers, stargazers). Non-parametric tests and correlations assessed\nrelationships with project dynamics and lifespan across quartiles. Results: CE\nmetrics significantly associate with project dynamics, with stronger\ncorrelations in highly engaged projects.

Effective and efficient scalable clone\ndetection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language\nmodels (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the\nrapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and\npotential LLM-ensemble efficacy.\n  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering\nthem down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The\ncandidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and\na commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though\nCodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates\nsuggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and\ntailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a\ntop-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\\% precision: twice the precision of\npreviously used CodeBERT.\n  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the\nselected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results\nsuggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods\nlike maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling\napproach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the\nbest-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\\% over\nindividual LLM on the commercial large-scale code."}

However, reviewers often work\nunder time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the\ndynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such\nbehaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is\ntypically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise\ncode with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but\nunexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze\nprogram behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible\nto reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context.\n  We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify\npotential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at\nruntime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties\nconsistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals\nof behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended\nchanges and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes.\n  We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from\nnon-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program\nversions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code\nblocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of\nregression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing.\nIt also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times\nhigher detection rates with fewer false alarms.

However, bugs within DL frameworks can\ncascade into critical issues in higher-level applications, jeopardizing\nreliability and security. While numerous techniques have been proposed to\ndetect bugs in DL frameworks, research exploring common API patterns across\nframeworks and the potential risks they entail remains limited. Notably, many\nDL frameworks expose similar APIs with overlapping input parameters and\nfunctionalities, rendering them vulnerable to shared bugs, where a flaw in one\nAPI may extend to analogous APIs in other frameworks. To address this\nchallenge, we propose MirrorFuzz, an automated API fuzzing solution to discover\nshared bugs in DL frameworks. MirrorFuzz operates in three stages: First,\nMirrorFuzz collects historical bug data for each API within a DL framework to\nidentify potentially buggy APIs. Second, it matches each buggy API in a\nspecific framework with similar APIs within and across other DL frameworks.\nThird, it employs large language models (LLMs) to synthesize code for the API\nunder test, leveraging the historical bug data of similar APIs to trigger\nanalogous bugs across APIs. We implement MirrorFuzz and evaluate it on four\npopular DL frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, OneFlow, and Jittor).
