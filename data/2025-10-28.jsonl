As newer releases of these libraries are published,\ndevelopers may opt to pin their dependencies to a particular version. While\npinning may have benefits in ensuring reproducible builds and avoiding breaking\nchanges, it bears larger risks in using outdated dependencies that may contain\nbugs and security vulnerabilities. To understand the frequency and consequences\nof dependency pinning, we first define the concepts of stale and fresh pins,\nwhich are distinguished based on how outdated the dependency is relative to the\nrelease date of the project. We conduct an empirical study to show that over\n60% of consumers of popular Maven libraries contain stale pins to their\ndependencies, with some outdated versions over a year old. These pinned\nversions often miss out on security fixes; we find that 10% of all dependency\nupgrades in our dataset to the latest minor or patch version would reduce\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n  We prototype an approach called Pin-Freshener that can encourage developers\nto freshen their pins by leveraging the insight that crowdsourced tests of peer\nprojects can provide additional signal for the safety of an upgrade. Running\nPin-Freshener on dependency upgrades shows that just 1-5 additional test suites\ncan provide 35-100% more coverage of a dependency, compared to that of a single\nconsumer test suite. Our evaluation on real-world pins to the top 500 popular\nlibraries in Maven shows that Pin-Freshener can provide an additional signal of\nat least 5 passing crowdsourced test suites to over 3,000 consumers to safely\nperform an upgrade that reduces security vulnerabilities. Pin-Freshener can\nprovide practical confidence to developers by offering additional signal beyond\ntheir own test suites, representing an improvement over current practices."}

While\nmachine learning, deep learning, and large language models (LLMs)-based methods\nhave advanced the LogAD, they often suffer from limited interpretability, high\ninference costs, and extensive preprocessing requirements, limiting their\npracticality for real-time, high-volume log analysis. In contrast, rule-based\nsystems offer efficiency and transparency, but require significant manual\neffort and are difficult to scale across diverse and evolving environments. In\nthis paper, We present CodeAD, a novel framework that automatically synthesizes\nlightweight Python rule functions for LogAD using LLMs. CodeAD introduces a\nhierarchical clustering and anchor-grounded sampling strategy to construct\nrepresentative contrastive log windows, enabling LLMs to discern discriminative\nanomaly patterns. To ensure robustness and generalizability, CodeAD employs an\nagentic workflow that iteratively generates, tests, repairs, and refines the\nrules until it meets correctness and abstraction requirements. The synthesized\nrules are interpretable, lightweight, and directly executable on raw logs,\nsupporting efficient and transparent online anomaly detection. Our\ncomprehensive experiments on three public datasets (BGL, Hadoop, Thunderbird)\ndemonstrate that CodeAD achieves an average absolute improvement of 3.6% F1\nscore over the state-of-the-art baselines, while processing large datasets up\nto 4x faster and at a fraction of the cost (total LLM invocation cost under 4\nUSD per dataset). These results highlight CodeAD as a practical and scalable\nsolution for online monitoring systems, enabling interpretable, efficient, and\nautomated LogAD in real-world environment."}

Prior multi-agent\nframeworks attempt to address these challenges through collaboration, yet they\noften suffer from rigid workflows and high reasoning recovery costs. To\novercome these limitations, we propose TALM (Tree-Structured Multi-Agent\nFramework with Long-Term Memory), a dynamic framework that integrates\nstructured task decomposition, localized re-reasoning, and long-term memory\nmechanisms. TALM employs an extensible tree-based collaboration structure. The\nparent-child relationships, when combined with a divide-and-conquer strategy,\nenhance reasoning flexibility and enable efficient error correction across\ndiverse task scopes. Furthermore, a long-term memory module enables semantic\nquerying and integration of prior knowledge, supporting implicit\nself-improvement through experience reuse.

Large language\nmodels (LLMs) show strong potential to automate this process and outperform\nprevious techniques. They can also enable new tasks, such as generating\nrequirements specifications.\n  [Question-Problem] Despite their potential, the use of LLMs to analyze user\nfeedback for RE remains underexplored. Existing studies offer limited empirical\nevidence, lack thorough evaluation, and rarely provide replication packages,\nundermining validity and reproducibility.\n  [Principal Idea-Results] We evaluate five lightweight open-source LLMs on\nthree RE tasks: user request classification, NFR classification, and\nrequirements specification generation. Classification performance was measured\non two feedback datasets, and specification quality via human evaluation. LLMs\nachieved moderate-to-high classification accuracy (F1 ~ 0.47-0.68) and\nmoderately high specification quality (mean ~ 3/5).\n  [Contributions] We newly explore lightweight LLMs for feedback-driven\nrequirements development.

Developers,\nhowever, often cut corners when following style rules, leading to the wide\nadoption of tools such as linters in professional software development\nprojects. Traditional linters like Checkstyle operate using rigid, rule-based\nmechanisms that effectively detect many surface-level violations. However, in\nmost programming languages, there is a subset of style rules that require a\nmore nuanced understanding of code, and fall outside the scope of such static\nanalysis. In this paper, we propose Checkstyle+, a hybrid approach that\naugments Checkstyle with large language model (LLM) capabilities, to identify\nstyle violations that elude the conventional rule-based analysis. Checkstyle+\nis evaluated on a sample of 380 Java code files, drawn from a broader dataset\nof 30,800 real-world Java programs sourced from accepted Codeforces\nsubmissions.

In\ndoing so, we construct NeuroCodeBench 2.0, a benchmark comprising 912 neural\nnetwork verification examples that cover activation functions, common layers,\nand full neural networks of up to 170K parameters. Our verification suite is\nwritten in plain C and is compatible with the format of the International\nCompetition on Software Verification (SV-COMP). Thanks to it, we can conduct\nthe first rigorous evaluation of eight state-of-the-art software verifiers on\nneural network code.
