To bridge\nthis gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs\nTrustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic\nassessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation\nframework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main\nimprovements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software\nengineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and\nMulti-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language,\ntext-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness\nAssessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code\ntransformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the\ntrustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and\nadaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26\nstate-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations,\nyielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance\nvariation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate\nspecific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;"}

However, their adoption often relies on informal\nexperimentation rather than structured guidance. \\textit{Aims:} This study\ninvestigates how software testing professionals use LLMs in practice to propose\na preliminary, practitioner-informed guideline to support their integration\ninto testing workflows. \\textit{Method:} We conducted a qualitative study with\n15 software testers from diverse roles and domains. Data were collected through\nsemi-structured interviews and analyzed using grounded theory-based processes\nfocused on thematic analysis. \\textit{Results:} Testers described an iterative\nand reflective process that included defining testing objectives, applying\nprompt engineering strategies, refining prompts, evaluating outputs, and\nlearning over time. They emphasized the need for human oversight and careful\nvalidation, especially due to known limitations of LLMs such as hallucinations\nand inconsistent reasoning. \\textit{Conclusions:} LLM adoption in software\ntesting is growing, but remains shaped by evolving practices and caution around\nrisks. This study offers a starting point for structuring LLM use in testing\ncontexts and invites future research to refine these practices across teams,\ntools, and tasks."}

Constrained\ndecoding techniques are developed to help the model generate code adhering to\nthe constraints by greedily eliminating generation options that violate\nconstraints at each step of the generation process. However, there is a severe\nlimitation of constrained decoding, that it distorts the model's output intent,\nforcing it to produce code that may satisfy the constraint but does not match\nthe development intent and is therefore incorrect. In response to this\nchallenge, we propose AdapTrack. By incorporating backtracking into the\ngeneration process, AdapTrack avoids distorting the output intent of the model,\nthereby producing results that are not only constraint-compliant but also more\nsemantically aligned with model's output intent. On our synthetic API\ncompletion dataset, AdapTrack can achieve up to 360.87% improvement compared to\nconstrained decoding; on the real-world API completion dataset we collect that\nexhibits similar issues, AdapTrack can achieve up to 38.93% improvement over\nconstrained decoding; in general code genration benchmarks, compared to\nconstrained decoding, AdapTrack can achieve up to 7.84% improvement on\nHumanEval, and up to 6.42% improvement on MBPP. This indicates that, simply by\nbetter adhering to the model's output intent, AdapTrack can achieve significant\nimprovements. We provide a theoretical proof that the distribution produced by\nAdapTrack aligns with the model's distribution given the generated tokens,\nthereby ensuring that the model's output intent is not distorted. Experiments\non DSL problems show that, compared to existing methods, our approach can\nprovide generation results that are more consistent with the language model's\ndistribution."}

If not addressed, Japan could potentially lose up to 12\ntrillion yen per year after 2025, which is 3 times more than the cost in\nprevious years. Asahi also faced the same internal challenges regarding legacy\nsystem, where manual maintenance workflows and limited QA environment have left\ncritical systems outdated and difficult to update. Middleware and OS version\nhave remained unchanged for years, leading to now its nearing end of service\nlife which require huge maintenance cost and effort to continue its operation.\nTo address this problem, we have developed and implemented a Scalable CI/CD\nPipeline where isolated development environments can be created and deleted\ndynamically and is scalable as needed.
