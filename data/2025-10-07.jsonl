While sound static analysis\ntools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging.\nPrior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only\nleaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits\nthe scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that\nstore a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes\nfour key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of\nwrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications\ninto the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about\nwrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze,\nmaking inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it\nmakes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a\nclient of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A\nnovel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling\nrepair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a\nnew repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored\nin non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR\nbenchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%."}

This has motivated the use of machine learning models to\npredict human comprehensibility directly from code, but these models have also\nshown limited accuracy.\n  We argue that model inaccuracy stems from inherent noise in human\ncomprehensibility data, which confuses models trained to predict it directly.\nTo address this, we propose training models to predict the relative\ncomprehensibility of two code snippets - that is, predicting which snippet a\nhuman would find easier to understand without predicting each snippet's\ncomprehensibility in isolation. This mitigates noise in predicting 'absolute'\ncomprehensibility measurements, but is still useful for downstream\nsoftware-engineering tasks like assessing whether refactoring improves or\nhinders comprehensibility.\n  We conducted a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of absolute and\nrelative code comprehensibility prediction via machine learning. We used a\ndataset of 150 Java code snippets and 12.5k human comprehensibility\nmeasurements from prior user studies, comparing the models' performance with\nnaive baselines (eg 'always predict the majority class').

In this study, we explore\nwhether instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines can\nenhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform diverse\nrefactoring tasks automatically. Leveraging the instruction-following and code\ncomprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-mini and\nDeepSeek-V3), we draw on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to design\nmultiple instruction strategies that encode motivations, procedural steps, and\ntransformation objectives for 61 well-known refactoring types. We evaluate\nthese strategies on benchmark examples and real-world code snippets from GitHub\nprojects. Our results show that instruction designs grounded in Fowler's\nguidelines enable LLMs to successfully perform all benchmark refactoring types\nand preserve program semantics in real-world settings, an essential criterion\nfor effective refactoring. Moreover, while descriptive instructions are more\ninterpretable to humans, our results show that rule-based instructions often\nlead to better performance in specific scenarios. Interestingly, allowing\nmodels to focus on the overall goal of refactoring, rather than prescribing a\nfixed transformation type, can yield even greater improvements in code quality."}

As such, developers need to be equipped with an\nin-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.\nUnfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers\nfrom imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant\neffort to accurately discern necessary permissions. This potentially leads to\nincorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially\nresulting in security violations and app failures. Recent efforts in improving\npermission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to\nuncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework. Yet, these\nmethodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability\nto Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a\npropensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate\ncodebases. This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language\nmodels (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings.

Recently, many\nneural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task. These models seek\nto make inferences based on their training data. Consequently, they better\ndetect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle\nto detect those they have not. Developers seeking clones are, of course,\ninterested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature\nreview, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's\ngoal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of\ndifferent functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six\nstate-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative\nLLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments\nreveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models. LLMs\nperform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone\ndetection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up\nto 5% (average 3%) instead. We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive\nlearning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen\nfunctionality. We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural\nlanguage processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring\nsimilarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during\ntraining. We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a\ncontrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive\nin-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between\nclones and non-clones.

Gall"], "title": "Multi Language Models for On-the-Fly Syntax Highlighting", "comment": null, "summary": "Syntax highlighting is a critical feature in modern software development\nenvironments, enhancing code readability and developer productivity. However,\ndelivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online\nand web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on\nbackend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently,\neven when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax\nhighlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is\nserved, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To\nmeet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to\nlearn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are\neasy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction\nprocess, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that\nachieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success,\nsuch models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per\nmodel, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve\nresource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means\nmaintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and\noperational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified\nmodel capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages,\nreducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on\nunseen languages. A novel normalization technique significantly enhances model\ngeneralization, while few-shot learning experiments show that a small number of\noracle samples can replace large datasets, minimizing dependence on brute-force\ngenerators. Combined, these innovations enable efficient, scalable, and\ncost-effective syntax highlighting across diverse programming languages."}

Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find\nthat existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture\nreal-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based\nmethods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four\nwidely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark\nsimplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks\nand identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and\ntelemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework\nto generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated\nfailure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic\nworkloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact.\nRe-evaluation of 11 SOTA models on this dataset shows low Top@1 accuracy\n(average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times.

Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or\nLLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces,\nand typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated\ndevelopment agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework\nthat leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification\nof NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to\ninterpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and\nexecute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector\nsystematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification\nprocess, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to\niteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code\ngeneration in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that\nunifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for\nsupervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the\nend-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a\ncomprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria\nannotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection\nof requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for\nseamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven\ndevelopment workflows.

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and\nmodernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally,\nsuch migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With\nthe advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic\nframeworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been\nsystematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel\nbenchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a\nspecific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics\nand avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test\ncoverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established\nrule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228\nrepositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can\nsuccessfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis\nreveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current\nagentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world\napplicability.

It also imposes tooling and\noperational costs to implement in practice. In an era of centralized registries\nsuch as PyPI, npm, Maven Central, and Hugging Face, it is reasonable to ask\nwhether hardening registry security controls obviates the need for end-to-end\nartifact signing. In this work, we posit that the core guarantees of signing,\nprovenance, integrity, and accountability are not automatically carried across\ndifferent software distribution boundaries. These boundaries include mirrors,\ncorporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers, where registry\nsecurity controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance. We synthesize\nhistorical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to\nidentify when signing is necessary to extend trust beyond registry control.\nTreating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply\nchain assurance even when registries are secure."}
