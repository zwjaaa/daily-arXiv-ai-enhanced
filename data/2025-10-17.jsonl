Finding and\nfixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more\nconcerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they\nprovide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other\nparts of the program.\n  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear\nrepeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different\nprograms, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our\ninvestigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise\nthe security of software programs.
