To address this\ngap, we present OBsmith, a novel framework to systematically test JavaScript\nobfuscators using large language models (LLMs).

Compared to rule-based translation which produces Rust code that\nremains largely unsafe, LLM-based methods can generate more idiomatic and safer\nRust code because LLMs have been trained on vast amount of human-written\nidiomatic code. Although promising, existing LLM-based methods still struggle\nwith project-level C-to-Rust translation. They typically partition a C project\ninto smaller units (\\eg{} functions) based on call graphs and translate them\nbottom-up to resolve program dependencies. However, this bottom-up,\nunit-by-unit paradigm often fails to translate pointers due to the lack of a\nglobal perspective on their usage. To address this problem, we propose a novel\nC-Rust Pointer Knowledge Graph (KG) that enriches a code-dependency graph with\ntwo types of pointer semantics: (i) pointer-usage information which record\nglobal behaviors such as points-to flows and map lower-level struct usage to\nhigher-level units; and (ii) Rust-oriented annotations which encode ownership,\nmutability, nullability, and lifetime. Synthesizing the \\kg{} with LLMs, we\nfurther propose \\ourtool{}, which implements a project-level C-to-Rust\ntranslation technique. In \\ourtool{}, the \\kg{} provides LLMs with\ncomprehensive pointer semantics from a global perspective, thus guiding LLMs\ntowards generating safe and idiomatic Rust code from a given C project. Our\nexperiments show that \\ourtool{} reduces unsafe usages in translated Rust by\n99.9\\% compared to both rule-based translation and traditional LLM-based\nrewriting, while achieving an average 29.3\\% higher functional correctness than\nthose fuzzing-enhanced LLM methods."}

However, two key challenges\nhinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and\nheterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the\nreasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to\nfully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to\nrely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs\nin addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose\nDebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools\nfor standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and\nan external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit\npedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes\na complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools\nfor specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step\nand reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool\ncalls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible,\nallowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and\nimproving the accuracy of the generated suggestions.
