This has further resulted in universities integrating\nprogramming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only\ntechnical studies but also business and management fields of study.\n  Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and\ntutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of\nthis, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing\nscalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and\ninstant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for\ngenerating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback\nthat can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)\nin recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can\nenhance feedback quality and personalization.\n  To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by\nstudents, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have\nconducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different\nuniversities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard\nUnit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality\nand impact on student performance.\n  Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most\nhelpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances.\nThese findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize\nautomated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming\neducation."}

Although the\nresource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) lies at the core of\nproject management activities, it remains largely disconnected from the broader\nliterature on model-based systems engineering (MBSE), thereby limiting its\nintegration into the design and management of complex systems. The original\ncontribution of this paper is twofold. First, the paper seeks to reconcile the\nRCPSP with the broader literature and vocabulary of model-based systems\nengineering and hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT). A concrete translation\npipeline from an activity-on-node network to a SysML activity diagram, and then\nto an operand net is constructed. Using this representation, it specializes the\nhetero-functional network minimum-cost flow (HFNMCF) formulation to the RCPSP\ncontext as a systematic means of HFGT for quantitative analysis and proves that\nthe RCPSP is recoverable as a special case of a broader model. Secondly, on an\nillustrative instance with renewable and non-renewable operands, the\nspecialized HFNMCF, while producing similar schedules, yields explicit\nexplanations of the project states that enable richer monitoring and control.\nOverall, the framework preserves the strengths of the classical RCPSP while\naccommodating real-world constraints and enterprise-level decision processes\nencountered in large, complex megaprojects."}

GitHub hosts numerous smart contract repositories containing\nsource code, documentation, and configuration files-these serve as intermediate\ndevelopment artifacts that must be compiled and packaged before deployment.\nThird-party developers often reference, reuse, or fork code from these\nrepositories during custom development. However, if the referenced code\ncontains vulnerabilities, it can introduce significant security risks. Existing\ntools for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities are limited in their ability\nto handle complex repositories, as they typically require the target contract\nto be compilable to generate an abstract representation for further analysis.\nThis paper presents TRACE, a tool designed to secure non-compilable smart\ncontract repositories against access control vulnerabilities. TRACE employs\nLLMs to locate sensitive functions involving critical operations (e.g.,\ntransfer) within the contract and subsequently completes function snippets into\na fully compilable contract. TRACE constructs a function call graph from the\nabstract syntax tree (AST) of the completed contract. It uses the control flow\ngraph (CFG) of each function as node information.
