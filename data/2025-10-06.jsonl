Yet, these foundational aspects are often overlooked\nin existing benchmarks, making it difficult to evaluate autoscaling methods\nunder realistic conditions. In this paper, we identify a set of practical\nauto-scaling considerations by applying several state-of-the-art autoscaling\nmethods to widely used microservice benchmarks. To structure these findings, we\nclassify the issues based on when they arise during the software lifecycle:\nArchitecture, Implementation, and Deployment. The Architecture phase covers\nhigh-level decisions such as service decomposition and inter-service\ndependencies.

Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of\ngenerated code, but there is far less on code quality.\n  Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating\nthe quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which\nthe quality of LLM generated code should be improved.\n  Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code\nquality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of\nprofessionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets\naccording to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to\nrepresent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also\npresent an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with\nthe Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four\nstate-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon.\n  Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code\nsmells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with\na smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%)\nand finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was\n63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design\nsmells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more\ncomplex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving\nobject-orientated concepts.\n  Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding\ntask complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human\nwritten code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM\ngenerated code is noticeably poorer than human written code."}

However, this migration process remains largely manual and\nlabour-intensive. While existing literature offers various strategies for\ndecomposing monoliths, these approaches primarily focus on architecture-level\nguidance, often overlooking the code-level challenges and dependencies that\ndevelopers must address during the migration. This article introduces a\ncatalogue of seven refactorings specifically designed to support the transition\nto a microservices architecture with a focus on handling dependencies. The\ncatalogue provides developers with a systematic guide that consolidates\nrefactorings identified in the literature and addresses the critical gap in\nsystematizing the process at the code level. By offering a structured,\nstep-by-step approach, this work simplifies the migration process and lays the\ngroundwork for its potential automation, empowering developers to implement\nthese changes efficiently and effectively."}

Therefore, assessing the quality of oracles is\ncrucial to improve the overall effectiveness of the testing process. Existing\nmetrics have been used for this purpose, but they either fail to provide a\ncomprehensive basis for guiding oracle improvement, or they are tailored to\nspecific types of oracles, thus limiting their generality.\n  In this paper, we introduce state field coverage, a novel metric for\nassessing oracle quality. This metric measures the proportion of an object's\nstate, as statically defined by its class fields, that an oracle may access\nduring test execution. The main intuition of our metric is that oracles with a\nhigher state field coverage are more likely to detect faults in the software\nunder analysis, as they inspect a larger portion of the object states to\ndetermine whether tests pass or not.\n  We implement a mechanism to statically compute the state field coverage\nmetric. Being statically computed, the metric is efficient and provides direct\nguidance for improving test oracles by identifying state fields that remain\nunexamined. We evaluate state field coverage through experiments involving 273\nrepresentation invariants and 249,027 test assertions. The results show that\nstate field coverage is a well-suited metric for assessing oracle quality, as\nit strongly correlates with the oracles' fault-detection ability, measured by\nmutation score."}

We argue that code communicates\nthrough two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and\nhuman-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel\nseverely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models\nregress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent\nreductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing\nthat current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than\ngenuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite\nof semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier\nleakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we\nrelease ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically\nsuppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that\nClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization\nshortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code\nunderstanding and generalization."}

Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise,\nwasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We\nintroduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug\nabstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the\nagentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that\nare unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on\nthree sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches\ngenerated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported\nbugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise\nsuccess rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points,\nrespectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer\nexceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports,\npatch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This\ntwo-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale\ndeployment of agentic APR systems."}
