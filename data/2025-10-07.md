### [1] [Repairing Leaks in Resource Wrappers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03461)
*Sanjay Malakar,Michael D. Ernst,Martin Kellogg,Manu Sridharan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents Arodnap, a system that improves resource leak repair by handling resource wrappers through specification inference, program transformation, field containment analysis, and new repair patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior resource leak repair approaches were limited to hard-coded library resource types and couldn't handle resource wrappers that store resources in fields, limiting their effectiveness in real-world code.

Method: The approach integrates resource management specification inference, program transformation for easier analysis, field containment analysis for reasoning about resource lifetimes, and introduces new repair patterns for non-final fields.

Result: Arodnap fixes 68% of resource leak warnings in the NJR benchmark suite, significantly improving over prior work that fixed only 41%.

Conclusion: The integrated approach with specification inference, program transformation, and enhanced field analysis enables more effective resource leak repair in real-world code with resource wrappers.

Abstract: A resource leak occurs when a program fails to release a finite resource like
a socket, file descriptor or database connection. While sound static analysis
tools can detect all leaks, automatically repairing them remains challenging.
Prior work took the output of a detection tool and attempted to repair only
leaks from a hard-coded list of library resource types. That approach limits
the scope of repairable leaks: real-world code uses resource wrappers that
store a resource in a field and must themselves be closed. This paper makes
four key contributions to improve resource leak repair in the presence of
wrappers. (1) It integrates inference of resource management specifications
into the repair pipeline, enabling extant fixing approaches to reason about
wrappers. (2) It transforms programs into variants that are easier to analyze,
making inference, detection, and fixing tools more effective; for instance, it
makes detection tools report problems closer to the root cause, often in a
client of a resource wrapper rather than within the wrapper class itself. (3) A
novel field containment analysis reasons about resource lifetimes, enabling
repair of more leaks involving resources stored in fields. (4) It introduces a
new repair pattern and more precise reasoning to better handle resources stored
in non-final fields. Prior work fixed 41% of resource leak warnings in the NJR
benchmark suite; our implementation Arodnap fixes 68%.

### [2] [ALMAS: an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03463)
*Vali Tawosi,Keshav Ramani,Salwa Alamir,Xiaomo Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ALMAS is an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework that integrates with agile software development teams to perform end-to-end tasks across the software development life-cycle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM systems in software development focus mainly on code implementation, testing, and maintenance, but software development is multifaceted and requires consideration of multiple SDLC stages.

Method: Proposes ALMAS framework with agents aligned to agile roles, designed to work modularly with human developers and their development environment.

Result: Demonstrated through published works and a use case where ALMAS successfully generated an application and added a new feature seamlessly.

Conclusion: ALMAS represents a vision for autonomous LLM-based multi-agent systems that can effectively integrate with agile software development teams across the entire SDLC.

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have been leading the way in
applied LLM research across a number of fields. One notable area is software
development, where researchers have advanced the automation of code
implementation, code testing, code maintenance, inter alia, using LLM agents.
However, software development is a multifaceted environment that extends beyond
just code. As such, a successful LLM system must factor in multiple stages of
the software development life-cycle (SDLC). In this paper, we propose a vision
for ALMAS, an Autonomous LLM-based Multi-Agent Software Engineering framework,
which follows the above SDLC philosophy such that it may work within an agile
software development team to perform several tasks end-to-end. ALMAS aligns its
agents with agile roles, and can be used in a modular fashion to seamlessly
integrate with human developers and their development environment. We showcase
the progress towards ALMAS through our published works and a use case
demonstrating the framework, where ALMAS is able to seamlessly generate an
application and add a new feature.

### [3] [Relative Code Comprehensibility Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03474)
*Nadeeshan De Silva,Martin Kellogg,Oscar Chaparro*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes predicting relative code comprehensibility (which of two snippets is easier to understand) instead of absolute comprehensibility, achieving much better performance than traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code comprehensibility metrics and ML models show poor correlation with actual human understanding due to inherent noise in human comprehensibility data.

Method: Train ML models to predict relative comprehensibility between two code snippets rather than absolute comprehensibility scores, using a dataset of 150 Java snippets with 12.5k human measurements.

Result: Relative comprehensibility models achieved 137.8% and 74.7% average improvements for snippet-wise and developer-wise prediction, while absolute models improved by at most 33.4% and often underperformed.

Conclusion: Relative comprehensibility prediction is more effective than absolute prediction and supports practical applicability for software engineering tasks like refactoring assessment.

Abstract: Automatically predicting how difficult it is for humans to understand a code
snippet can assist developers in tasks like deciding when and where to
refactor. Despite many proposed code comprehensibility metrics, studies have
shown they often correlate poorly with actual measurements of human
comprehensibility. This has motivated the use of machine learning models to
predict human comprehensibility directly from code, but these models have also
shown limited accuracy.
  We argue that model inaccuracy stems from inherent noise in human
comprehensibility data, which confuses models trained to predict it directly.
To address this, we propose training models to predict the relative
comprehensibility of two code snippets - that is, predicting which snippet a
human would find easier to understand without predicting each snippet's
comprehensibility in isolation. This mitigates noise in predicting 'absolute'
comprehensibility measurements, but is still useful for downstream
software-engineering tasks like assessing whether refactoring improves or
hinders comprehensibility.
  We conducted a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of absolute and
relative code comprehensibility prediction via machine learning. We used a
dataset of 150 Java code snippets and 12.5k human comprehensibility
measurements from prior user studies, comparing the models' performance with
naive baselines (eg 'always predict the majority class'). Our findings indicate
that absolute comprehensibility models improve over the baselines by at most
33.4% and frequently underperform. In contrast, relative comprehensibility
models are substantially better, with average improvements of 137.8% and 74.7%
for snippet-wise and developer-wise prediction, respectively. These results
suggest that relative comprehensibility models learn more effectively from the
data, supporting their practical applicability for downstream SE tasks.

### [4] [LLM Agents for Automated Dependency Upgrades](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03480)
*Vali Tawosi,Salwa Alamir,Xiaomo Liu,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A framework of LLM agents that automatically updates Java library dependencies by localizing outdated usages and applying fixes using migration documentation, achieving 71.4% precision with fewer tokens than state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As codebases expand, library dependencies become outdated, requiring updates for innovation and security. Manual updates are time-consuming due to breaking changes, necessitating automated solutions.

Method: Uses a multi-agent framework (Summary Agent, Control Agent, Code Agent) combined with migration documentation to automatically localize and update library usages in Java codebases.

Result: Achieved 71.4% precision in code updates and used fewer tokens than state-of-the-art methods across three synthetic code repositories with major upgrade changes.

Conclusion: The LLM agent framework provides an efficient and effective automated solution for library dependency updates, outperforming existing methods in both token efficiency and precision.

Abstract: As a codebase expands over time, its library dependencies can become outdated
and require updates to maintain innovation and security. However, updating a
library can introduce breaking changes in the code, necessitating significant
developer time for maintenance. To address this, we introduce a framework of
LLM agents to be used in combination with migration documentation to
automatically recommend and apply code updates and ensure compatibility with
new versions. Our solution can automatically localize updated library usages in
live Java codebases and implement recommended fixes in a user-friendly manner.
The system architecture consists of multiple key components: a Summary Agent,
Control Agent, and Code Agent. To validate our approach, we apply the framework
on an industrial use case by which we create three synthetic code repositories
with major Upgrade changes and benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art
methods. Results show that our approach not only performs upgrades using fewer
tokens across all cases but also achieves a precision of 71.4%, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.

### [5] [AgentHub: A Research Agenda for Agent Sharing Infrastructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03495)
*Erik Pautsch,Tanmay Singla,Wenxin Jiang,Huiyun Peng,Behnaz Hassanshahi,Konstantin Läufer,George K. Thiruvathukal,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: AgentHub proposes a research agenda for building comprehensive infrastructure for LLM-based agent sharing, addressing current fragmentation in discovery, evaluation, and governance compared to mature software ecosystems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current infrastructure for LLM-based agents is fragmented, focusing narrowly on distribution, naming, or protocols, while broader software engineering requirements are needed to improve open-source distribution and reuse.

Method: Proposes AgentHub as a research agenda that frames key challenges including capability clarity, lifecycle transparency, interoperability, governance, security, and workflow integration.

Result: Charts a community-wide agenda for building reliable and scalable agent ecosystems, though specific implementation results are not detailed as this is a vision paper.

Conclusion: Envisions a future where agents can be shared, trusted, and composed as seamlessly as today's software libraries through comprehensive infrastructure development.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are rapidly proliferating, yet the infrastructure for
discovering, evaluating, and governing them remains fragmented compared to
mature ecosystems like software package registries (e.g., npm) and model hubs
(e.g., Hugging Face). Recent research and engineering works have begun to
consider the requisite infrastructure, but so far they focus narrowly -- on
distribution, naming, or protocol negotiation. However, considering broader
software engineering requirements would improve open-source distribution and
ease reuse. We therefore propose AgentHub, a research agenda for agent sharing.
By framing the key challenges of capability clarity, lifecycle transparency,
interoperability, governance, security, and workflow integration, AgentHub
charts a community-wide agenda for building reliable and scalable agent
ecosystems. Our vision is a future where agents can be shared, trusted, and
composed as seamlessly as today's software libraries.

### [6] [REFINE: Enhancing Program Repair Agents through Context-Aware Patch Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03588)
*Anvith Pabba,Simin Chen,Alex Mathai,Anindya Chakraborty,Baishakhi Ray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Refine is a patch refinement framework that transforms Draft Patches from LLM-based APR systems into correct patches by addressing context ambiguity, diversifying candidates, and aggregating partial fixes through LLM-powered code review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based APR techniques struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited code context understanding and over-reliance on incomplete test suites, often generating Draft Patches that are partially correct but not fully functional.

Method: Refine addresses three challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. It's implemented as a general refinement module for APR systems.

Result: On SWE-Bench Lite, Refine achieves state-of-the-art results (51.67%) among workflow-based approaches, boosting AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%. On SWE-Bench Verified, it improves resolution rate by 12.2%, with average 14% improvement across multiple APR systems.

Conclusion: Refine demonstrates the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in
automatic program repair (APR), especially in repository-level settings where
the goal is to generate patches based on natural language issue descriptions,
large codebases, and regression tests. However, despite their promise, current
LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited
understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a
result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that
either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work,
we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically
transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key
challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch
candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an
LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement
module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR
systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine
achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and
approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically,
Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of
51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine
improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR
systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad
effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness
of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential
of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct
patches. We also open source our code.

### [7] [Generating High-Level Test Cases from Requirements using LLM: An Industry Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03641)
*Satoshi Masuda,Satoshi Kouzawa,Kyousuke Sezai,Hidetoshi Suhara,Yasuaki Hiruta,Kunihiro Kudou*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes a method for automatically generating high-level test cases from requirement documents using LLMs without RAG, by first generating test design techniques and then test cases for each technique.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual generation of high-level test cases is labor-intensive, and current LLM approaches using RAG require custom knowledge systems for each application, which is not scalable.

Method: Two-step approach: 1) Input requirement document to LLM to generate test design techniques, 2) Generate high-level test cases for each technique. Uses semantic similarity for evaluation.

Result: Achieved macro-recall of 0.81 on Bluetooth dataset and 0.37 on Mozilla dataset, showing feasibility for practical application.

Conclusion: The proposed method is feasible for practical high-level test case generation without RAG, providing a more generalized approach across different requirement documents.

Abstract: Currently, generating high-level test cases described in natural language
from requirement documents is performed manually. In the industry, including
companies specializing in software testing, there is a significant demand for
the automatic generation of high-level test cases from requirement documents
using Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts to utilize LLMs for requirement
analysis are underway. In some cases, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is
employed for generating high-level test cases using LLMs. However, in practical
applications, it is necessary to create a RAG tailored to the knowledge system
of each specific application, which is labor-intensive. Moreover, when applying
high-level test case generation as a prompt, there is no established method for
instructing the generation of high-level test cases at a level applicable to
other specifications without using RAG. It is required to establish a method
for the automatic generation of high-level test cases that can be generalized
across a wider range of requirement documents. In this paper, we propose a
method for generating high-level (GHL) test cases from requirement documents
using only prompts, without creating RAGs. In the proposed method, first, the
requirement document is input into the LLM to generate test design techniques
corresponding to the requirement document. Then, high-level test cases are
generated for each of the generated test design techniques. Furthermore, we
verify an evaluation method based on semantic similarity of the generated
high-level test cases. In the experiments, we confirmed the method using
datasets from Bluetooth and Mozilla, where requirement documents and high-level
test cases are available, achieving macro-recall measurement of 0.81 and 0.37,
respectively. We believe that the method is feasible for practical application
in generating high-level test cases without using RAG.

### [8] [Detecting and Preventing Latent Risk Accumulation in High-Performance Software Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03712)
*Jahidul Arafat,Kh. M. Moniruzzaman,Shamim Hossain,Fariha Tasmin,Kamrujjaman,Ahsan Habib Tareq*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A framework for detecting and preventing latent risks in distributed systems caused by aggressive optimizations, using mathematical modeling, perturbation testing, and risk-aware optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern distributed systems use aggressive optimizations that create hidden vulnerabilities, where high performance masks catastrophic fragility when optimizations fail. Current reliability engineering focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of optimization-induced vulnerabilities.

Method: Integrated framework with three systems: HYDRA (optimization-aware perturbation testing with 6 strategies), RAVEN (continuous production monitoring), and APEX (risk-aware optimization). Introduces Latent Risk Index (LRI) for predictive risk assessment.

Result: Strong statistical validation: 89.7% risk discovery rate, 92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, 96.6% baseline performance with 59.2% risk reduction. Production deployment showed 69.1% MTTR reduction, 78.6% incident severity reduction, 81 prevented incidents with 3.2-month ROI.

Conclusion: Transforms reliability engineering from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization, providing comprehensive latent risk detection and prevention.

Abstract: Modern distributed systems employ aggressive optimization strategies that
create latent risks - hidden vulnerabilities where exceptional performance
masks catastrophic fragility when optimizations fail. Cache layers achieving
99% hit rates can obscure database bottlenecks until cache failures trigger
100x load amplification and cascading collapse. Current reliability engineering
focuses on reactive incident response rather than proactive detection of
optimization-induced vulnerabilities. This paper presents the first
comprehensive framework for systematic latent risk detection, prevention, and
optimization through integrated mathematical modeling, intelligent perturbation
testing, and risk-aware performance optimization. We introduce the Latent Risk
Index (LRI) that correlates strongly with incident severity (r=0.863, p<0.001),
enabling predictive risk assessment. Our framework integrates three systems:
HYDRA employing six optimization-aware perturbation strategies achieving 89.7%
risk discovery rates, RAVEN providing continuous production monitoring with
92.9% precision and 93.8% recall across 1,748 scenarios, and APEX enabling
risk-aware optimization maintaining 96.6% baseline performance while reducing
latent risks by 59.2%. Evaluation across three testbed environments
demonstrates strong statistical validation with large effect sizes (Cohen
d>2.0) and exceptional reproducibility (r>0.92). Production deployment over 24
weeks shows 69.1% mean time to recovery reduction, 78.6% incident severity
reduction, and 81 prevented incidents generating 1.44M USD average annual
benefits with 3.2-month ROI. Our approach transforms reliability engineering
from reactive incident management to proactive risk-aware optimization.

### [9] [APIDA-Chat: Structured Synthesis of API Search Dialogues to Bootstrap Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03743)
*Zachary Eberhart,Collin McMillan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APIDA-Chat is an open-source pipeline that generates realistic API dialogue data using a teacher-student approach, enabling efficient fine-tuning of smaller models for niche API assistance without exposing proprietary code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models struggle with niche or proprietary APIs due to lack of training data, and existing solutions risk exposing sensitive code to external services.

Method: Two-phase approach: Phase I uses a teacher LLM with dialogue planner to create gold dialogues; Phase II fine-tunes a smaller student model (Llama 3.2 3B) that can generate new dialogues independently without external dependencies.

Result: Fine-tuned student model improves BLEU from 0.38 to 0.50 and BERTScore from 0.88 to 0.91, running entirely on a single consumer GPU.

Conclusion: APIDA-Chat provides a modular, cost-effective solution for generating API dialogue training data while maintaining code privacy, serving as a baseline for future research.

Abstract: Large-language-model assistants are suitable for explaining popular APIs, yet
they falter on niche or proprietary libraries because the multi-turn dialogue
data needed for fine-tuning are scarce. We present APIDA-Chat, an open-source
pipeline that converts symbolic dialogue-act "scripts" into realistic,
domain-grounded API Search conversations using a lightweight model for
inexpensive training data generation. Phase I pairs a legacy dialogue planner
with a high-capability teacher LLM (o4-mini) to synthesize a "gold set" of
realized dialogues; then, a smaller Llama 3.2 3B student model is fine-tuned on
this corpus. Phase II drops the teacher and reuses the same planner with the
fine-tuned model, allowing rapid, low-cost synthesis of new dialogues without
exposing source code to external services. The fine-tuned student improves BLEU
from 0.38 to 0.50 and BERTScore from 0.88 to 0.91 versus the base model while
running entirely on a single consumer GPU. All components are modular and
publicly released to serve as a conservative baseline for future work.
APIDA-Chat is open-sourced at https://github.com/Zeberhart/apida-chat and a

*Roham Koohestani,Parham Bateni,Aydin Ebrahimi,Behdad Etezadi,Kiarash Karimi,Maliheh Izadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Code4MeV2 is an open-source code completion plugin for JetBrains IDEs that addresses the lack of accessible user interaction data from AI code completion tools, featuring modular data collection for research purposes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprietary AI code completion tools limit academic research by keeping user interaction data inaccessible, making reproducible studies and large-scale analysis difficult.

Method: Developed a client-server plugin with inline code completion and context-aware chat assistant, featuring a modular data collection framework for fine-grained telemetry control.

Result: Achieves industry-comparable performance with 200ms average latency, validated through expert evaluation and user study with positive feedback from researchers and users.

Conclusion: Code4MeV2 successfully provides an open-source alternative for studying human-AI interaction in code completion, inviting community adoption and contribution.

Abstract: The adoption of AI-powered code completion tools in software development has
increased substantially, yet the user interaction data produced by these
systems remain proprietary within large corporations. This creates a barrier
for the academic community, as researchers must often develop dedicated
platforms to conduct studies on human--AI interaction, making reproducible
research and large-scale data analysis impractical. In this work, we introduce
Code4MeV2, a research-oriented, open-source code completion plugin for
JetBrains IDEs, as a solution to this limitation. Code4MeV2 is designed using a
client--server architecture and features inline code completion and a
context-aware chat assistant. Its core contribution is a modular and
transparent data collection framework that gives researchers fine-grained
control over telemetry and context gathering. Code4MeV2 achieves
industry-comparable performance in terms of code completion, with an average
latency of 200~ms. We assess our tool through a combination of an expert
evaluation and a user study with eight participants. Feedback from both
researchers and daily users highlights its informativeness and usefulness. We
invite the community to adopt and contribute to this tool. More information
about the tool can be found at https://app.code4me.me.

### [11] [A First Look at the Lifecycle of DL-Specific Self-Admitted Technical Debt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03802)
*Gilberto Recupito,Vincenzo De Martino,Dario Di Nucci,Fabio Palomba*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This study analyzes the lifecycle of DL-specific Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in deep learning systems, finding it's introduced early/mid-development, persists longest in training and hardware phases, and occurs frequently during feature implementation and bug fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-enabled systems introduce unique challenges to software quality, with SATD emerging as a critical concern affecting maintainability. The lifecycle of DL-specific SATD remains underexplored despite its significant impact.

Method: Used mining software repository techniques to examine 40 ML projects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. Tracked SATD introduction and persistence through commit histories to assess lifecycle and developer actions.

Result: DL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during early and middle development stages. Training and Hardware phases showed longest SATD durations. Developers introduce SATD more frequently during feature implementation and bug fixes.

Conclusion: Targeted DL-specific SATD management strategies are needed in DL-enabled systems. Understanding temporal characteristics and evolution of SATD helps prioritize interventions at critical stages to improve system maintainability and quality.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Deep Learning (DL)-enabled systems has revolutionized
software development, driving innovation across various domains. However, these
systems also introduce unique challenges, particularly in maintaining software
quality and performance. Among these challenges, Self-Admitted Technical Debt
(SATD) has emerged as a growing concern, significantly impacting the
maintainability and overall quality of ML and DL-enabled systems. Despite its
critical implications, the lifecycle of DL-specific SATD, how developers
introduce, acknowledge, and address it over time-remains underexplored. This
study presents a preliminary analysis of the persistence and lifecycle of
DL-specific SATD in DL-enabled systems. The purpose of this project is to
uncover the patterns of SATD introduction, recognition, and durability during
the development life cycle, providing information on how to manage these
issues. Using mining software repository techniques, we examined 40 ML
projects, focusing on 185 DL-specific SATD instances. The analysis tracked the
introduction and persistence of SATD instances through project commit histories
to assess their lifecycle and developer actions. The findings indicate that
DL-specific SATD is predominantly introduced during the early and middle stages
of project development. Training and Hardware phases showed the longest SATD
durations, highlighting critical areas where debt accumulates and persists.
Additionally, developers introduce DL-specific SATD more frequently during
feature implementation and bug fixes. This study emphasizes the need for
targeted DL-specific SATD management strategies in DL-enabled systems to
mitigate its impact. By understanding the temporal characteristics and
evolution of DL-specific SATD, developers can prioritize interventions at
critical stages to improve the maintainability and quality of the system.

### [12] [Smart Paste: Automatically Fixing Copy/Paste for Google Developers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03843)
*Vincent Nguyen,Guilherme Herzog,José Cambronero,Marcus Revaj,Aditya Kini,Alexander Frömmgen,Maxim Tabachnyk*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Smart Paste is an IDE feature that uses deep learning to suggest post-paste code edits, deployed at Google with 45% acceptance rate accounting for over 1% of all code written company-wide.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code pasting is 4x more common than manual typing at Google, and pasted code frequently requires follow-up edits ranging from simple formatting to complex style adjustments and cross-language translations.

Method: Iteratively developed and scaled an IDE feature using deep learning to predict and suggest post-paste edits, focusing on user experience, system integration, and model capabilities.

Result: Deployed successfully at Google with overwhelmingly positive feedback, achieving 45% acceptance rate for suggestions, which accounts for over 1% of all code written company-wide at enterprise scale.

Conclusion: Smart Paste demonstrates a holistic approach to AI feature development covering UX, system integration, and model capabilities, serving as a guide for AI practitioners on scaling such features in development environments.

Abstract: Manually editing pasted code is a long-standing developer pain point. In
internal software development at Google, we observe that code is pasted 4 times
more often than it is manually typed. These paste actions frequently require
follow-up edits, ranging from simple reformatting and renaming to more complex
style adjustments and cross-language translations. Prior work has shown deep
learning can be used to predict these edits. In this work, we show how to
iteratively develop and scale Smart Paste, an IDE feature for post-paste edit
suggestions, to Google's development environment. This experience can serve as
a guide for AI practitioners on a holistic approach to feature development,
covering user experience, system integration, and model capabilities. Since
deployment, Smart Paste has had overwhelmingly positive feedback with a 45%
acceptance rate. At Google's enterprise scale, these accepted suggestions
account substantially for over 1% of all code written company-wide.

### [13] [Designing Empirical Studies on LLM-Based Code Generation: Towards a Reference Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03862)
*Nathalia Nascimento,Everton Guimaraes,Paulo Alencar*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes a theoretical framework for standardizing empirical evaluation of LLM-based code generation to address lack of comparability and reproducibility in current studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current empirical evaluation of LLM-based code generation lacks standardization, with studies varying widely in goals, tasks, and metrics, limiting comparability and reproducibility.

Method: Developed a theoretical framework grounded in prior experience and comparative analysis of recent studies, organizing evaluation around core components like problem sources, quality attributes, and metrics.

Result: Created a framework that supports structured and systematic experimentation, demonstrated through representative case mappings, with identified opportunities for refinement.

Conclusion: The framework provides a foundation for standardizing LLM evaluation in software engineering contexts, with plans to evolve it into a more robust and mature tool.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced transformative
potential in automated code generation, addressing a wide range of software
engineering challenges. However, empirical evaluation of LLM-based code
generation lacks standardization, with studies varying widely in goals, tasks,
and metrics, which limits comparability and reproducibility. In this paper, we
propose a theoretical framework for designing and reporting empirical studies
on LLM-based code generation. The framework is grounded in both our prior
experience conducting such experiments and a comparative analysis of key
similarities and differences among recent studies. It organizes evaluation
around core components such as problem sources, quality attributes, and
metrics, supporting structured and systematic experimentation. We demonstrate
its applicability through representative case mappings and identify
opportunities for refinement. Looking forward, we plan to evolve the framework
into a more robust and mature tool for standardizing LLM evaluation across
software engineering contexts.

### [14] [Adversarial Agent Collaboration for C to Rust Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03879)
*Tianyu Li,Ruishi Li,Bo Wang,Brandon Paulsen,Umang Mathur,Prateek Saxena*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ACToR is an adversarial LLM agent-based system that translates C code to memory-safe Rust by pitting a generator agent against a discriminator agent, achieving over 90% test pass rate on real-world command line utilities averaging 485 LoC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing C to Rust translation approaches fail on larger codebases (>500 LoC) due to complex program analyses that break frequently, creating a need for more robust translation methods.

Method: Uses adversarial approach inspired by GANs: generator agent synthesizes/refines Rust translation to pass tests, while discriminator agent finds new failing tests for iterative improvement.

Result: Successfully translated all 63 real-world command line utilities (avg 485 LoC) with over 90% test pass rate, improving correctness by up to 18.9% compared to non-adversarial baselines.

Conclusion: ACToR is the first system to reliably translate C programs at this scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of adversarial LLM agent collaboration for automated code translation.

Abstract: Translating C to memory-safe languages, like Rust, prevents critical memory
safety vulnerabilities that are prevalent in legacy C software. Existing
approaches for C to safe Rust translation, including LLM-assisted ones, do not
generalize on larger (> 500 LoC) C codebases because they depend on complex
program analyses that frequently break. In this work, we present ACToR
(Adversarial C To Rust translator), a simple LLM agent-based approach. Inspired
by GANs, ACToR pits a generator agent against a discriminator agent, which
collaborate to iteratively generate a Rust translation. On each iteration, the
translator agent synthesizes and refines a Rust translation to pass an existing
suite of tests, and then the discriminator agent finds new failing tests. We
demonstrate that ACToR translates all of the 63 real-world command line
utilities considered in our benchmarks, which have an average size of 485 lines
of code, and it achieves over 90% test pass rate with zero human intervention.
To our knowledge, it is the first such system that reliably translates C
programs of this scale. Furthermore, ACToR improves translation correctness by
up to 18.9% compared to baseline, non-adversarial approaches.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Service-Oriented Quantum (SOQ) is a new paradigm that treats quantum services as autonomous, composable entities rather than auxiliary components, enabling scalable integration of quantum computing into real-world software systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing faces integration challenges due to hardware fragility, platform heterogeneity, and lack of robust software engineering practices, limiting its practical implementation in real-world systems.

Method: SOQ reimagines quantum software through classical service-oriented computing principles, defining foundational principles and proposing a layered technology stack to support autonomous quantum services.

Result: The paper establishes SOQ as a framework that enables modular, interoperable quantum service integration without relying on dedicated classical environments to manage quantum processing.

Conclusion: SOQ is vital for advancing quantum technology by providing scalable, modular integration of quantum computing into real-world software systems independently of classical management environments.

Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly progressing from theoretical promise to
practical implementation, offering significant computational advantages for
tasks in optimization, simulation, cryptography, and machine learning. However,
its integration into real-world software systems remains constrained by
hardware fragility, platform heterogeneity, and the absence of robust software
engineering practices. This paper introduces Service-Oriented Quantum (SOQ), a
novel paradigm that reimagines quantum software systems through the lens of
classical service-oriented computing. Unlike prior approaches such as Quantum
Service-Oriented Computing (QSOC), which treat quantum capabilities as
auxiliary components within classical systems, SOQ positions quantum services
as autonomous, composable, and interoperable entities. We define the
foundational principles of SOQ, propose a layered technology stack to support
its realization, and identify the key research and engineering challenges that
must be addressed, including interoperability, hybridity, pricing models,
service abstractions, and workforce development. This approach is of vital
importance for the advancement of quantum technology because it enables the
scalable, modular, and interoperable integration of quantum computing into
real-world software systems independently and without relying on a dedicated
classical environment to manage quantum processing.

TL;DR: The waterfall model remains relevant as a component in modern hybrid development frameworks, not as a standalone methodology but through its adaptability and integration with agile methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a historical and critical overview of the waterfall model's evolution, assess its present utility, and examine its role in contemporary development practices.

Method: Drawing on scholarly sources to synthesize key developments in the perception and application of the waterfall model, tracing its origins, formalization, and evolution through industry adoption.

Result: The waterfall model has shifted from a standalone framework to a component within modern hybrid methodologies, maintaining relevance through adaptability and integration with agile approaches.

Conclusion: The waterfall model's enduring relevance lies in its adaptability and integration within hybrid approaches, allowing practitioners to make informed methodology decisions in diverse development environments.

Abstract: The waterfall model, one of the earliest software development methodologies,
has played a foundational role in shaping contemporary software engineering
practices. This paper provides a historical and critical overview of the model,
tracing its conceptual origins in software engineering, its formalization by
Royce, and its evolution through decades of industry adoption and critique.
Although often criticized for its rigidity, shortcomings, and high failure
rates, the waterfall model persists in specific domains. Its principles
continue to influence contemporary hybrid development frameworks that combine
traditional and agile methods. Drawing on a range of scholarly sources, this
study synthesizes key developments in the perception and application of the
waterfall model. The analysis highlights how the model has shifted from a
standalone framework to a component within modern hybrid methodologies. By
revisiting its origins, assessing its present utility, and examining its role
in contemporary development practices, this paper argues that the waterfall
model remains relevant, not as a relic of the past but as part of context-aware
development strategies. The paper contends that the model's enduring relevance
lies in its adaptability. By recognizing both its limitations and its
strengths, and by understanding its integration within hybrid approaches,
practitioners can make more informed decisions about methodology selection and
process design in diverse development environments.

*Rana Nameer Hussain Khan,Dawood Wasif,Jin-Hee Cho,Ali Butt*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MACOG is a multi-agent LLM architecture for Infrastructure-as-Code generation that decomposes the task into specialized agents working together via a shared-blackboard orchestrator to produce syntactically valid, policy-compliant Terraform configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional monolithic LLM approaches for IaC generation often result in syntactic errors, policy violations, and unscalable designs, requiring a more systematic approach.

Method: Multi-agent architecture with specialized agents (Architect, Provider Harmonizer, Engineer, Reviewer, Security Prover, Cost and Capacity Planner, DevOps, Memory Curator) interacting via shared-blackboard and finite-state orchestrator, incorporating Terraform Plan for validation and Open Policy Agent for policy enforcement.

Result: MACOG achieves top enhancement on IaC-Eval benchmark: GPT-5 improves from 54.90 (RAG) to 74.02 and Gemini-2.5 Pro from 43.56 to 60.13, with gains on BLEU, CodeBERTScore, and LLM-judge metrics. Ablations show constrained decoding and deploy feedback are critical.

Conclusion: The multi-agent approach effectively addresses limitations of monolithic LLM generation for IaC, producing higher quality, policy-compliant infrastructure code through specialized decomposition and orchestration.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cloud-native infrastructure has made
Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) essential for reproducible and scalable
deployments. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating IaC snippets from natural language prompts, their monolithic,
single-pass generation approach often results in syntactic errors, policy
violations, and unscalable designs. In this paper, we propose MACOG
(Multi-Agent Code-Orchestrated Generation), a novel multi-agent LLM-based
architecture for IaC generation that decomposes the task into modular subtasks
handled by specialized agents: Architect, Provider Harmonizer, Engineer,
Reviewer, Security Prover, Cost and Capacity Planner, DevOps, and Memory
Curator. The agents interact via a shared-blackboard, finite-state orchestrator
layer, and collectively produce Terraform configurations that are not only
syntactically valid but also policy-compliant and semantically coherent. To
ensure infrastructure correctness and governance, we incorporate Terraform Plan
for execution validation and Open Policy Agent (OPA) for customizable policy
enforcement. We evaluate MACOG using the IaC-Eval benchmark, where MACOG is the
top enhancement across models, e.g., GPT-5 improves from 54.90 (RAG) to 74.02
and Gemini-2.5 Pro from 43.56 to 60.13, with concurrent gains on BLEU,
CodeBERTScore, and an LLM-judge metric. Ablations show constrained decoding and
deploy feedback are critical: removing them drops IaC-Eval to 64.89 and 56.93,
respectively.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper explores using instruction strategies based on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to enhance LLMs' ability to perform diverse automated code refactoring tasks, showing improved performance across 61 refactoring types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often neglect refactoring due to time, effort, and lack of immediate rewards. Existing automated tools are limited in supporting diverse refactoring types, creating a need for more comprehensive automated solutions.

Method: Leveraged state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-mini and DeepSeek-V3) with instruction strategies based on Fowler's refactoring guidelines. Designed multiple instruction strategies encoding motivations, procedural steps, and transformation objectives for 61 refactoring types. Evaluated on benchmark examples and real-world GitHub code.

Result: Instruction designs based on Fowler's guidelines enabled LLMs to successfully perform all benchmark refactoring types and preserve program semantics in real-world settings. Rule-based instructions performed better in specific scenarios, and goal-focused instructions yielded greater code quality improvements than fixed transformation types.

Conclusion: Instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines significantly enhance LLMs' refactoring capabilities. The approach successfully automates diverse refactoring tasks while preserving program semantics, with goal-focused instructions showing particular promise for code quality improvement.

Abstract: Code refactoring is a fundamental software engineering practice aimed at
improving code quality and maintainability. Despite its importance, developers
often neglect refactoring due to the significant time, effort, and resources it
requires, as well as the lack of immediate functional rewards. Although several
automated refactoring tools have been proposed, they remain limited in
supporting a broad spectrum of refactoring types. In this study, we explore
whether instruction strategies inspired by human best-practice guidelines can
enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform diverse
refactoring tasks automatically. Leveraging the instruction-following and code
comprehension capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., GPT-mini and
DeepSeek-V3), we draw on Martin Fowler's refactoring guidelines to design
multiple instruction strategies that encode motivations, procedural steps, and
transformation objectives for 61 well-known refactoring types. We evaluate
these strategies on benchmark examples and real-world code snippets from GitHub
projects. Our results show that instruction designs grounded in Fowler's
guidelines enable LLMs to successfully perform all benchmark refactoring types
and preserve program semantics in real-world settings, an essential criterion
for effective refactoring. Moreover, while descriptive instructions are more
interpretable to humans, our results show that rule-based instructions often
lead to better performance in specific scenarios. Interestingly, allowing
models to focus on the overall goal of refactoring, rather than prescribing a
fixed transformation type, can yield even greater improvements in code quality.

### [20] [Bamboo: LLM-Driven Discovery of API-Permission Mappings in the Android Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04078)
*Han Hu,Wei Minn,Yonghui Liu,Jiakun Liu,Ferdian Thung,Terry Yue Zhuo,Lwin Khin Shar,Debin Gao,David Lo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a novel approach using large language models (LLMs) to systematically discover API-permission mappings in Android, addressing limitations of existing methods and improving documentation completeness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android's official API documentation suffers from imprecision and incompleteness regarding permissions, causing developers to spend significant effort and potentially leading to security violations and app failures. Existing static/dynamic analysis methods have poor adaptability to updates, limited code coverage, and miss complex mappings.

Method: The approach utilizes large language models (LLMs) with a dual-role prompting strategy and API-driven code generation to systematically examine API-permission mappings. A corresponding tool called \tool{} was developed.

Result: The tool identified 2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and 10 respectively, substantially outperforming existing baselines.

Conclusion: The LLM-based approach successfully addresses the limitations of traditional methods for discovering API-permission mappings in Android, providing more comprehensive and adaptable results across different SDK versions.

Abstract: The permission mechanism in the Android Framework is integral to safeguarding
the privacy of users by managing users' and processes' access to sensitive
resources and operations. As such, developers need to be equipped with an
in-depth understanding of API permissions to build robust Android apps.
Unfortunately, the official API documentation by Android chronically suffers
from imprecision and incompleteness, causing developers to spend significant
effort to accurately discern necessary permissions. This potentially leads to
incorrect permission declarations in Android app development, potentially
resulting in security violations and app failures. Recent efforts in improving
permission specification primarily leverage static and dynamic code analyses to
uncover API-permission mappings within the Android framework. Yet, these
methodologies encounter substantial shortcomings, including poor adaptability
to Android SDK and Framework updates, restricted code coverage, and a
propensity to overlook essential API-permission mappings in intricate
codebases. This paper introduces a pioneering approach utilizing large language
models (LLMs) for a systematic examination of API-permission mappings. In
addition to employing LLMs, we integrate a dual-role prompting strategy and an
API-driven code generation approach into our mapping discovery pipeline,
resulting in the development of the corresponding tool, \tool{}. We formulate
three research questions to evaluate the efficacy of \tool{} against
state-of-the-art baselines, assess the completeness of official SDK
documentation, and analyze the evolution of permission-required APIs across
different SDK releases. Our experimental results reveal that \tool{} identifies
2,234, 3,552, and 4,576 API-permission mappings in Android versions 6, 7, and
10 respectively, substantially outprforming existing baselines.

### [22] [Detecting Semantic Clones of Unseen Functionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04143)
*Konstantinos Kitsios,Francesco Sovrano,Earl T. Barr,Alberto Bacchelli*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Semantic code clone detection models struggle with unseen functionalities. While current models achieve near-perfect performance on seen clones, they drop up to 48% F1 on unseen functionalities. LLMs generalize better with only 5% F1 drop. Contrastive learning improves performance by up to 26% for task-specific models and 5% for LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural models for semantic code clone detection perform well on clones similar to their training data but struggle with unseen functionalities, which developers also need to detect. The paper identifies three practical scenarios where models must detect clones of functionalities not seen during training.

Method: Re-evaluated six state-of-the-art models on detecting clones of unseen functionality. Proposed contrastive learning approaches: replacing final classifier with contrastive classifier for task-specific models, and contrastive in-context learning for LLMs to focus on differences between clones and non-clones.

Result: Task-specific models showed F1 drop of up to 48% (average 31%) on unseen functionalities. LLMs performed similarly to task-specific models but generalized better with only 5% F1 drop (average 3%). Contrastive learning improved F1 by up to 26% (average 9%) for task-specific models and up to 5% (average 3%) for LLMs.

Conclusion: Current clone detection models have poor generalization to unseen functionalities. LLMs show better generalization without explicit training. Contrastive learning effectively improves performance on unseen functionalities for both task-specific models and LLMs, addressing the generalization gap in semantic code clone detection.

Abstract: Semantic code clone detection is the task of detecting whether two snippets
of code implement the same functionality (e.g., Sort Array). Recently, many
neural models achieved near-perfect performance on this task. These models seek
to make inferences based on their training data. Consequently, they better
detect clones similar to those they have seen during training and may struggle
to detect those they have not. Developers seeking clones are, of course,
interested in both types of clones. We confirm this claim through a literature
review, identifying three practical clone detection tasks in which the model's
goal is to detect clones of a functionality even if it was trained on clones of
different functionalities. In light of this finding, we re-evaluate six
state-of-the-art models, including both task-specific models and generative
LLMs, on the task of detecting clones of unseen functionality. Our experiments
reveal a drop in F1 of up to 48% (average 31%) for task-specific models. LLMs
perform on par with task-specific models without explicit training for clone
detection, but generalize better to unseen functionalities, where F1 drops up
to 5% (average 3%) instead. We propose and evaluate the use of contrastive
learning to improve the performance of existing models on clones of unseen
functionality. We draw inspiration from the computer vision and natural
language processing fields where contrastive learning excels at measuring
similarity between two objects, even if they come from classes unseen during
training. We replace the final classifier of the task-specific models with a
contrastive classifier, while for the generative LLMs we propose contrastive
in-context learning, guiding the LLMs to focus on the differences between
clones and non-clones. The F1 on clones of unseen functionality is improved by
up to 26% (average 9%) for task-specific models and up to 5% (average 3%) for
LLMs.

### [23] [Multi Language Models for On-the-Fly Syntax Highlighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04166)
*Marco Edoardo Palma,Pooja Rani,Harald C. Gall*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper introduces a unified deep learning model for syntax highlighting that supports multiple programming languages, reducing deployment complexity and improving generalization through novel normalization techniques and few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current syntax highlighting models are language-specific, requiring multiple models for multi-language environments, which increases system complexity and operational costs. They also depend on large datasets from slow brute-force generators.

Method: Developed a unified model capable of highlighting up to six programming languages using a novel normalization technique for better generalization. Employed few-shot learning to reduce dependency on large datasets from brute-force generators.

Result: The unified model reduces deployment complexity by a factor of six and improves performance on unseen languages. Few-shot learning experiments show that small oracle samples can replace large datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed innovations enable efficient, scalable, and cost-effective syntax highlighting across diverse programming languages, addressing key challenges in multi-language development environments.

Abstract: Syntax highlighting is a critical feature in modern software development
environments, enhancing code readability and developer productivity. However,
delivering accurate highlighting in real time remains challenging for online
and web-based development tools due to strict time and memory constraints on
backend services. These systems must serve highlights rapidly and frequently,
even when code is partially valid or invalid. This has led to on-the-fly syntax
highlighting, where visual annotations are generated just before content is
served, often at high request rates and under incomplete input conditions. To
meet these demands efficiently, state-of-the-art models use deep learning to
learn the behavior of brute-force syntax highlighting resolvers, tools that are
easy to implement but too slow for production. Through the Deep Abstraction
process, brute-force strategies are encoded into fast statistical models that
achieve both high accuracy and low-latency inference. Despite their success,
such models face key challenges: they support only one programming language per
model, require large datasets from slow brute-force generators, and involve
resource-intensive training. In multi-language environments, this means
maintaining multiple independent models, increasing system complexity and
operational cost. This work addresses these issues by introducing a unified
model capable of highlighting up to six mainstream programming languages,
reducing deployment complexity by a factor of six and improving performance on
unseen languages. A novel normalization technique significantly enhances model
generalization, while few-shot learning experiments show that a small number of
oracle samples can replace large datasets, minimizing dependence on brute-force
generators. Combined, these innovations enable efficient, scalable, and
cost-effective syntax highlighting across diverse programming languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how access to Large Language Models and varying levels of professional software development experience influence the prioritization of cybersecurity requirements for web applications.

Method: 23 postgraduate students participated in prioritizing security requirements using MoSCoW method. Divided into two groups (with/without LLM support). Rated solutions against multiple evaluation criteria.

Result: No significant differences related to LLM use. Statistically significant differences between experience groups for cost estimation, user experience impact, and risk assessment. More experienced participants gave higher UX impact ratings and lower risk estimates.

Conclusion: LLM access doesn't significantly influence cybersecurity requirement evaluation, but professional experience affects how developers assess cost, user experience impact, and risk factors.

Abstract: This study investigates how access to Large Language Models (LLMs) and
varying levels of professional software development experience affect the
prioritization of cybersecurity requirements for web applications. Twenty-three
postgraduate students participated in a research study to prioritize security
requirements (SRs) using the MoSCoW method and subsequently rated their
proposed solutions against multiple evaluation criteria. We divided
participants into two groups (one with and the other without access to LLM
support during the task). Results showed no significant differences related to
LLM use, suggesting that access to LLMs did not noticeably influence how
participants evaluated cybersecurity solutions. However, statistically
significant differences emerged between experience groups for certain criteria,
such as estimated cost to develop a feature, perceived impact on user
experience, and risk assessment related to non-implementation of the proposed
feature. Participants with more professional experience tended to provide
higher ratings for user experience impact and lower risk estimates.

persistent challenges, such as ambiguity, conflicting stakeholder needs, and
the complexity of managing evolving requirements. A common view is that
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to streamline the RE process,
resulting in improved efficiency, accuracy, and management actions. However,
using AI also introduces new concerns, such as ethical issues, biases, and lack
of transparency. This paper explores how AI can enhance traditional RE
practices by automating labor-intensive tasks, supporting requirement
prioritization, and facilitating collaboration between stakeholders and AI
systems. The paper also describes the opportunities and challenges that AI
brings to RE. In particular, the vision calls for ethical practices in AI,
along with a much-enhanced collaboration between academia and industry
professionals. The focus should be on creating not only powerful but also
trustworthy and practical AI solutions ready to adapt to the fast-paced world
of software development.

### [29] [Improving IR-based Bug Localization with Semantics-Driven Query Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04468)
*Asif Mohammed Samir,Mohammad Masudur Rahman*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: IQLoc is a novel bug localization approach that combines IR and LLM methods to improve software bug localization by leveraging program semantics understanding and query reformulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing bug localization methods have limitations - IR-based approaches overlook code context and semantics, while LLMs are not well-adapted for bug localization and can be resource-intensive.

Method: IQLoc integrates transformer-based models' program semantics understanding with Information Retrieval, using LLMs to reason about code suspiciousness and reformulate queries during bug localization.

Result: IQLoc achieves superior performance with up to 58.52-60.59% MAP, 61.49-64.58% MRR, and 69.88-100.90% HIT@K. It particularly improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces, 72.73% for those with code elements, and 65.38% for natural language descriptions.

Conclusion: By integrating program semantic understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc effectively mitigates longstanding challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.

Abstract: Despite decades of research, software bug localization remains challenging
due to heterogeneous content and inherent ambiguities in bug reports. Existing
methods such as Information Retrieval (IR)-based approaches often attempt to
match source documents to bug reports, overlooking the context and semantics of
the source code. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLM) (e.g.,
Transformer models) show promising results in understanding both texts and
code. However, they have not been yet adapted well to localize software bugs
against bug reports. They could be also data or resource-intensive. To bridge
this gap, we propose, IQLoc, a novel bug localization approach that capitalizes
on the strengths of both IR and LLM-based approaches. In particular, we
leverage the program semantics understanding of transformer-based models to
reason about the suspiciousness of code and reformulate queries during bug
localization using Information Retrieval. To evaluate IQLoc, we refine the
Bench4BL benchmark dataset and extend it by incorporating ~30% more recent bug
reports, resulting in a benchmark containing ~7.5K bug reports. We evaluated
IQLoc using three performance metrics and compare it against four baseline
techniques. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority, achieving up to
58.52% and 60.59% in MAP, 61.49% and 64.58% in MRR, and 69.88% and 100.90% in
HIT@K for the test bug reports with random and time-wise splits, respectively.
Moreover, IQLoc improves MAP by 91.67% for bug reports with stack traces,
72.73% for those that include code elements, and 65.38% for those containing
only descriptions in natural language. By integrating program semantic
understanding into Information Retrieval, IQLoc mitigates several longstanding
challenges of traditional IR-based approaches in bug localization.

*Wenqi Yan,Toby Murray,Benjamin Rubinstein,Van-Thuan Pham*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DynamiQ is an optimized parallel fuzzing system that uses program call graph structure for task allocation and runtime feedback to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art fuzzers in coverage and bug discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of existing parallel fuzzing approaches that treat individual seeds as tasks, leading to redundant exploration and reduced efficiency at scale.

Method: Leverages structural information from program call graphs to define tasks, continuously refines task allocation using runtime feedback, and incorporates practical optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing built on the LibAFL framework.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in code coverage and vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used open-source software during 25,000 CPU hours of evaluation on 12 real-world targets.

Conclusion: DynamiQ demonstrates that structural task definition and adaptive allocation significantly enhance parallel fuzzing efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional seed-based approaches.

Abstract: We present DynamiQ, a full-fledged and optimized successor to AFLTeam that
supports dynamic and adaptive parallel fuzzing. Unlike most existing approaches
that treat individual seeds as tasks, DynamiQ leverages structural information
from the program's call graph to define tasks and continuously refines task
allocation using runtime feedback. This design significantly reduces redundant
exploration and enhances fuzzing efficiency at scale. Built on top of the
state-of-the-art LibAFL framework, DynamiQ incorporates several practical
optimizations in both task allocation and task-aware fuzzing. Evaluated on 12
real-world targets from OSS-Fuzz and FuzzBench over 25,000 CPU hours, DynamiQ
outperforms state-of-the-art parallel fuzzers in both code coverage and
vulnerability discovery, uncovering 9 previously unknown bugs in widely used
and extensively fuzzed open-source software.

*Napasorn Tevarut,Brittany Reid,Yutaro Kashiwa,Pattara Leelaprute,Arnon Rungsawang,Bundit Manaskasemsak,Hajimu Iida*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper refines definitions of trivial and data-only packages in the npm ecosystem, develops a static analysis method to detect them, and finds that 17.92% of packages are trivial with comparable vulnerability levels to non-trivial packages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trivial packages (small modules with low functionality) are common in npm and pose security risks despite their simplicity, requiring better detection and understanding of their prevalence and risks.

Method: Developed a rule-based static analysis method to detect trivial and data-only packages, and evaluated their prevalence and associated risks in the 2025 npm ecosystem.

Result: 17.92% of packages are trivial with vulnerability levels comparable to non-trivial ones; data-only packages are rare but also contain risks; detection tool achieves 94% accuracy (macro-F1 0.87).

Conclusion: Trivial and data-only packages warrant greater attention in dependency management to reduce potential technical debt and security exposure.

Abstract: Trivial packages, small modules with low functionality, are common in the npm
ecosystem and can pose security risks despite their simplicity. This paper
refines existing definitions and introduce data-only packages that contain no
executable logic. A rule-based static analysis method is developed to detect
trivial and data-only packages and evaluate their prevalence and associated
risks in the 2025 npm ecosystem. The analysis shows that 17.92% of packages are
trivial, with vulnerability levels comparable to non-trivial ones, and
data-only packages, though rare, also contain risks. The proposed detection
tool achieves 94% accuracy (macro-F1 0.87), enabling effective large-scale
analysis to reduce security exposure. This findings suggest that trivial and
data-only packages warrant greater attention in dependency management to reduce
potential technical debt and security exposure.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Spec2Control is an automated LLM workflow that generates graphical control logic directly from natural language requirements for distributed control systems, achieving 98.6% accuracy in control strategy connections and saving 94-96% of human labor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming distributed control systems (DCS) for industrial processes is manual, tedious, and costly (millions of dollars). Existing LLM-based tools are limited to textual notations, provide limited automation, and lack testing on large datasets with realistic cases.

Method: Spec2Control uses a highly automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from natural language user requirements, tested on an open dataset with 10 control narratives and 65 complex test cases.

Result: Spec2Control successfully identifies control strategies, generates 98.6% of correct control strategy connections autonomously, and saves between 94-96% of human labor.

Conclusion: Spec2Control demonstrates high automation and accuracy in generating DCS control logic from natural language, with commercial integration into ABB engineering tools and an open-source variant available for validation.

Abstract: Distributed control systems (DCS) manage the automation for many industrial
production processes (e.g., power plants, chemical refineries, steel mills).
Programming the software for such systems remains a largely manual and tedious
process, incurring costs of millions of dollars for extensive facilities. Large
language models (LLMs) have been found helpful in generating DCS control logic,
resulting in commercial copilot tools. Today, these tools are focused on
textual notations, they provide limited automation, and have not been tested on
large datasets with realistic test cases. We introduce Spec2Control, a highly
automated LLM workflow to generate graphical control logic directly from
natural language user requirements. Experiments using an open dataset with 10
control narratives and 65 complex test cases demonstrate that Spec2Control can
successfully identify control strategies, can generate 98.6% of correct control
strategy connections autonomously, and can save between 94-96% of human labor.
Spec2Control is being integrated into commercial ABB engineering tools, but is
also available as an open-source variant for independent validation.

TL;DR: This study analyzes OSS adoption in 16 digitally mature countries, examining policies, goals, actors, and support mechanisms to propose indicators for digital government maturity indexes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remains limited despite OSS being a vital public good that impacts GDP, national tech growth, interoperability, sovereignty, and transparency.

Method: Qualitative approach combining desk research of policy documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives, producing detailed country reports that are cross-analyzed.

Result: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, governed by central public sector organizations, with goals including interoperability, digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels.

Conclusion: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital transformation. Clear policy frameworks and institutional support like OSPOs are essential, and international digital maturity frameworks should expand OSS indicators to better guide government adoption.

Abstract: Context: Open Source Software (OSS) is a vital public good, included across
most of modern software stacks, significantly impacting GDP and national tech
growth, while supporting interoperability, sovereignty, and transparency.
However, systematic measurement of governmental OSS adoption remain limited.
  Research Aim: This study contributes to digital government maturity indexes
by analyzing policies and support actions leveraging OSS for software reuse and
collaborative development across 16 digitally mature countries, and proposing
potential indicators for said indexes. It examines OSS policy formation, stated
goals, key actors, and support mechanisms.
  Methodology: A qualitative approach is used combining desk research of policy
documents with semi-structured interviews of government representatives,
producing detailed country reports. These are cross-analyzed, focusing on OSS
policy promotion, rationale, and implementation support.
  Results: Policies facilitating OSS reuse are widespread, targeting both
inbound acquisition and outbound sharing, and are predominantly governed by
central public sector organizations. Policy goals include interoperability,
digital sovereignty, transparency, and cost efficiency, with security framed
both as a risk and strength. Implementation is supported by diverse Open Source
Program Offices (OSPOs) at multiple government levels, which foster capacity
building, resource pooling, and sustainable project governance. Indicators are
synthesized and proposed across 14 areas covering policy incentives and design,
and implementation and support.
  Conclusions: OSS is a strategic enabler for public sector digital
transformation. Clear policy frameworks, coupled with institutional support
such as OSPOs, are essential. International digital maturity frameworks should
expand OSS indicators to better guide and assess government adoption and
impact.

Conclusion: Diffusion LLMs establish as a superior paradigm for software engineering tasks compared to autoregressive LLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (AR-LLMs) are widely used in software
engineering (SE) but face limitations in processing code structure information
and suffer from high inference latency. Diffusion LLMs (DLLMs) offer a
promising alternative with global bidirectional encoding and decoupled
generation steps. This work presents the first comprehensive evaluation of
DLLMs across the software development lifecycle, including code generation,

*Pawel Weichbroth,Maciej Lotysz,Michal Wrobel*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Emotional state of software developers has strong positive impact on perceived productivity (beta=0.893, p<0.001), highlighting importance of emotional well-being for productivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time pressure in software development often leads to diminished emotional state, but whether emotions affect perceived productivity was unknown.

Method: Two-stage survey approach: expert validation with 9 experts, then empirical testing with 88 developers using Partial Least Squares analysis.

Result: Path analysis confirmed hypothesis - emotional state has strong positive significant impact on perceived productivity (beta=0.893, p<0.001).

Conclusion: Managing developers' emotional well-being is crucial for productivity; interventions to reduce burnout and stress can significantly impact performance.

Abstract: The time pressure associated with software development, among other factors,
often leads to a diminished emotional state among developers. However, whether
emotions affect perceived productivity remains an open question. This study
aims to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between
emotional state and perceived productivity among software developers. We
employed a two-stage approach. First, a survey was conducted with a pool of
nine experts to validate the measurement model. Second, a survey was
administered to a pool of 88 software developers to empirically test the
formulated hypothesis by using Partial Least Squares, as the data analysis
method. The results of the path analysis clearly confirm the formulated
hypothesis, showing that the emotional state of a software developer has a
strong positive, and significant impact (beta = 0.893, p < 0.001) on perceived
productivity among software developers. The findings highlight the importance
of managing and improving developers emotional well-being to enhance
productivity in software development environments. Additionally, interventions
aimed at reducing burnout, stress, and other negative factors could have a
considerable impact on their performance outcomes.

*Chengwei Liu,Wenbo Guo,Yuxin Zhang,Limin Wang,Sen Chen,Lei Bu,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Evolaris is a self-evolving software intelligence system that uses a multi-agent framework to automatically collect, analyze, and validate threat information from diverse informal sources like blogs, social media, and forums to improve security threat analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional security vulnerability discovery through formal channels is insufficient as critical threat information increasingly emerges from informal sources like blogs, social media, and developer forums, creating challenges for timely threat intelligence collection and validation.

Method: A multi-agent framework where independent agents coordinate through shared context to perform information discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection, enabling the system to learn from new inputs and adapt to emerging threats.

Result: The system continuously improves precision, timeliness, and scalability of software threat analysis by learning from new inputs and refining internal knowledge over time.

Conclusion: Evolaris provides a sustainable foundation for proactive security decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security threat understanding through its self-evolving, adaptive architecture.

Abstract: In recent years, the landscape of software threats has become significantly
more dynamic and distributed. Security vulnerabilities are no longer discovered
and shared only through formal channels such as public vulnerability databases
or vendor advisories. Increasingly, criti- cal threat information emerges
informally through blogs, social media, developer forums, open source
repositories, and even underground com- munities. To this end, capturing such
intelligence in a timely manner is essential for maintaining situational
awareness and enabling prompt security responses. However, this remains a
complex challenge due to the fragmented nature of data sources and the
technical difficulty of collecting, parsing, mapping, and validating
information at scale. To ad- dress this, we propose Evolaris, a self-evolving
software intelligence sys- tem built on a multi-agent framework. Evolaris is
designed to support a full-stack workflow, where agents operate independently
but coordinate through shared context to perform tasks such as information
discovery, reasoning, gap completion, validation, and risk detection. This
archi- tecture enables the platform to learn from new inputs, refine its
internal knowledge, and adapt to emerging threat patterns over time, which
could continuously improve the precision, timeliness, and scalability of
software threat analysis, and offers a sustainable foundation for proactive
secu- rity decision-making and strengthens the broader ecosystem of security
threat understanding.

*Aoyang Fang,Songhan Zhang,Yifan Yang,Haotong Wu,Junjielong Xu,Xuyang Wang,Rui Wang,Manyi Wang,Qisheng Lu,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Existing RCA benchmarks are oversimplified, allowing simple rule-based methods to match SOTA models. A new realistic benchmark framework reveals that SOTA models perform poorly (average Top@1 accuracy 0.21) due to scalability, observability, and modeling issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current microservice RCA benchmarks are too simple and don't reflect real-world conditions, leading to overestimated performance of data-driven models.

Method: Systematic analysis of RCA benchmarks, development of automated framework to generate realistic benchmarks with 1,430 validated failure cases from 9,152 injections covering 25 fault types under dynamic workloads.

Result: Re-evaluation of 11 SOTA models shows low Top@1 accuracy (average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times. Identified three failure patterns: scalability issues, observability blind spots, and modeling bottlenecks.

Conclusion: Existing RCA benchmarks overestimate model performance. More realistic benchmarks are needed to properly evaluate RCA methods, as current SOTA models struggle with real-world complexity.

Abstract: While cloud-native microservice architectures have transformed software
development, their complexity makes Root Cause Analysis (RCA) both crucial and
challenging. Although many data-driven RCA models have been proposed, we find
that existing benchmarks are often oversimplified and fail to capture
real-world conditions. Our preliminary study shows that simple rule-based
methods can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on four
widely used benchmarks, suggesting performance overestimation due to benchmark
simplicity. To address this, we systematically analyze popular RCA benchmarks
and identify key limitations in fault injection, call graph design, and
telemetry patterns. Based on these insights, we develop an automated framework
to generate more realistic benchmarks, yielding a dataset of 1,430 validated
failure cases from 9,152 injections, covering 25 fault types under dynamic
workloads with hierarchical ground-truth labels and verified SLI impact.
Re-evaluation of 11 SOTA models on this dataset shows low Top@1 accuracy
(average 0.21, best 0.37) and significantly longer execution times. Our
analysis highlights three common failure patterns: scalability issues,
observability blind spots, and modeling bottlenecks.

TL;DR: GUISpector is a multi-modal LLM-based framework that automatically verifies natural language requirements in GUI prototypes, provides actionable feedback, and integrates with LLM-driven development workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing GUI testing approaches struggle with modern interface complexity and lack actionable feedback for integration with automated development agents, creating a need for better NL requirements verification.

Method: Uses a multi-modal LLM agent to interpret NL requirements, autonomously plan and execute verification trajectories across GUI applications, and extract detailed NL feedback for developers.

Result: Evaluated on 150 requirements across diverse GUI applications, effectively detecting requirement satisfaction and violations, demonstrating seamless integration with LLM-driven development workflows.

Conclusion: GUISpector successfully addresses the gap in GUI requirements verification by providing automated NL requirement validation and actionable feedback for iterative GUI refinement and LLM-based code generation.

Abstract: GUIs are foundational to interactive systems and play a pivotal role in early
requirements elicitation through prototyping. Ensuring that GUI implementations
fulfill NL requirements is essential for robust software engineering,
especially as LLM-driven programming agents become increasingly integrated into
development workflows. Existing GUI testing approaches, whether traditional or
LLM-driven, often fall short in handling the complexity of modern interfaces,
and typically lack actionable feedback and effective integration with automated
development agents. In this paper, we introduce GUISpector, a novel framework
that leverages a multi-modal (M)LLM-based agent for the automated verification
of NL requirements in GUI prototypes. First, GUISpector adapts a MLLM agent to
interpret and operationalize NL requirements, enabling to autonomously plan and
execute verification trajectories across GUI applications. Second, GUISpector
systematically extracts detailed NL feedback from the agent's verification
process, providing developers with actionable insights that can be used to
iteratively refine the GUI artifact or directly inform LLM-based code
generation in a closed feedback loop. Third, we present an integrated tool that
unifies these capabilities, offering practitioners an accessible interface for
supervising verification runs, inspecting agent rationales and managing the
end-to-end requirements verification process. We evaluated GUISpector on a
comprehensive set of 150 requirements based on 900 acceptance criteria
annotations across diverse GUI applications, demonstrating effective detection
of requirement satisfaction and violations and highlighting its potential for
seamless integration of actionable feedback into automated LLM-driven
development workflows. The video presentation of GUISpector is available at:

Motivation: Current code review research requires time-consuming manual scripting for data extraction from platforms like GitHub and GitLab, creating barriers for empirical studies.

Method: RevMine uses large language models to guide users through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data collection, supporting both quantitative and qualitative analysis.

Result: The tool streamlines the entire code review mining pipeline and reduces the need for manual scripting.

Conclusion: RevMine democratizes code review mining by lowering barriers to entry, enabling broader empirical software engineering studies.

Abstract: Empirical research on code review processes is increasingly central to
understanding software quality and collaboration. However, collecting and
analyzing review data remains a time-consuming and technically intensive task.
Most researchers follow similar workflows - writing ad hoc scripts to extract,
filter, and analyze review data from platforms like GitHub and GitLab. This
paper introduces RevMine, a conceptual tool that streamlines the entire code
review mining pipeline using large language models (LLMs). RevMine guides users
through authentication, endpoint discovery, and natural language-driven data
collection, significantly reducing the need for manual scripting. After
retrieving review data, it supports both quantitative and qualitative analysis
based on user-defined filters or LLM-inferred patterns. This poster outlines
the tool's architecture, use cases, and research potential. By lowering the
barrier to entry, RevMine aims to democratize code review mining and enable a
broader range of empirical software engineering studies.

TL;DR: InsightQL is a human-assisting framework for analyzing fuzz blockers in fuzzing, using a unified database and query interface to help developers systematically extract insights and improve code coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fuzzing often hits coverage plateaus due to fuzz blockers, limiting vulnerability discovery. Human expertise can help but analyzing results is labor-intensive.

Method: Developed InsightQL framework with unified database and parameterized query interface to assist developers in fuzz blocker analysis.

Result: Experiments on 14 real-world libraries from FuzzBench showed unblocking of many fuzz blockers and code coverage improvements up to 13.90%.

Conclusion: InsightQL effectively helps developers overcome fuzz blockers and significantly improves fuzzing coverage.

Abstract: Fuzzing is a highly effective automated testing method for uncovering
software vulnerabilities. Despite advances in fuzzing techniques, such as
coverage-guided greybox fuzzing, many fuzzers struggle with coverage plateaus
caused by fuzz blockers, limiting their ability to find deeper vulnerabilities.
Human expertise can address these challenges, but analyzing fuzzing results to
guide this support remains labor-intensive. To tackle this, we introduce
InsightQL, the first human-assisting framework for fuzz blocker analysis.
Powered by a unified database and an intuitive parameterized query interface,
InsightQL aids developers in systematically extracting insights and efficiently
unblocking fuzz blockers. Our experiments on 14 popular real-world libraries
from the FuzzBench benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of InsightQL,
leading to the unblocking of many fuzz blockers and considerable improvements
in code coverage (up to 13.90%).

Motivation: Traditional code migrations rely on rule-based systems and human intervention, but AI-driven frameworks using LLMs offer a promising alternative that needs systematic evaluation.

Method: Created FreshBrew benchmark with 228 repositories to evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on project-level Java migrations, comparing against rule-based tools with focus on test coverage for reliable assessment.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Flash successfully migrated 52.3% of projects to JDK 17, revealing critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches in real-world Java modernization tasks.

Conclusion: FreshBrew provides foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems and will facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation to catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.

Abstract: AI coding assistants are rapidly becoming integral to modern software
development. A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and
modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally,
such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With
the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic
frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been
systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel
benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a
specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics
and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test
coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several
state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established
rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228
repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can
successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis
reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current
agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world
applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents
in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating
trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to
facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven
codebase modernization.

### [43] [Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation: A Survey with Focus on Repository-Level Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04905)
*Yicheng Tao,Yao Qin,Yepang Liu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) focusing on repository-level approaches, categorizing existing work across multiple dimensions and analyzing current limitations and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world software development requires reasoning across entire repositories, but existing function-level and file-level code generation approaches are insufficient for capturing long-range dependencies and ensuring global semantic consistency in repository-level code generation (RLCG).

Method: The paper provides a systematic review and categorization of RACG research along dimensions including generation strategies, retrieval modalities, model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols.

Result: The survey establishes a unified analytical framework for understanding RACG, summarizes widely used datasets and benchmarks, and identifies current limitations in the field.

Conclusion: The work aims to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software engineering by providing comprehensive insights into repository-level code generation challenges and opportunities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level
generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development
typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the
challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must
capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and
generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these
challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing
context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an
emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along
several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities,
model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore,
we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations,
and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is
to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly
evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software
engineering.

### [44] [Why Software Signing (Still) Matters: Trust Boundaries in the Software Supply Chain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04964)
*Kelechi G. Kalu,James C. Davis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Software signing remains necessary despite secure registries because its core guarantees (provenance, integrity, accountability) don't automatically carry across distribution boundaries like mirrors, proxies, and air-gapped transfers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine if hardened registry security controls eliminate the need for end-to-end artifact signing in modern software distribution.

Method: Synthesize historical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to identify when signing is necessary beyond registry control.

Result: Found that signing is essential to extend trust beyond registry boundaries across various distribution scenarios including mirrors, corporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers.

Conclusion: Treating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply chain assurance even when registries are secure, as registry controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance across distribution boundaries.

Abstract: Software signing provides a formal mechanism for provenance by ensuring
artifact integrity and verifying producer identity. It also imposes tooling and
operational costs to implement in practice. In an era of centralized registries
such as PyPI, npm, Maven Central, and Hugging Face, it is reasonable to ask
whether hardening registry security controls obviates the need for end-to-end
artifact signing. In this work, we posit that the core guarantees of signing,
provenance, integrity, and accountability are not automatically carried across
different software distribution boundaries. These boundaries include mirrors,
corporate proxies, re-hosting, and air-gapped transfers, where registry
security controls alone cannot provide sufficient assurance. We synthesize
historical practice and present a trust model for modern distribution modes to
identify when signing is necessary to extend trust beyond registry control.
Treating signing as a baseline layer of defense strengthens software supply
chain assurance even when registries are secure.

### [45] [Quantum Computing as a Service - a Software Engineering Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04982)
*Aakash Ahmad,Muhammad Waseem,Bakheet Aljedaani,Mahdi Fahmideh,Peng Liang,Feras Awaysheh*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper proposes a process-centric and architecture-driven approach for Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) using a two-phase research method combining systematic mapping study and architecture-based development to identify quantum service development lifecycle phases and integrate them into a reference architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum computing is emerging as disruptive technology, and QCaaS is viewed as a service-oriented solution to offer quantum computing resources as utility computing to organizations without quantum computers. The research aims to provide a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS.

Method: Two-phase research method: (1) systematic mapping study to identify quantum service development lifecycle phases through analysis of 41 peer-reviewed studies, and (2) architecture-based development to integrate these phases into a reference architecture supporting QCaaS.

Result: Identified a 4-phased development lifecycle with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations, catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can be integrated in a layered reference architecture for engineering QCaaS.

Conclusion: The research successfully developed a reference architecture that supports QCaaS by integrating identified quantum service development lifecycle phases, providing a systematic approach for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of quantum services.

Abstract: Quantum systems have started to emerge as a disruptive technology and
enabling platforms - exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics via
programmable quantum bits (QuBits) - to achieve quantum supremacy in computing.
Academic research, industrial projects (e.g., Amazon Braket, IBM Qiskit), and
consortiums like 'Quantum Flagship' are striving to develop practically capable
and commercially viable quantum computing (QC) systems and technologies.
Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) is viewed as a solution attuned to the
philosophy of service-orientation that can offer QC resources and platforms, as
utility computing, to individuals and organisations who do not own quantum
computers. This research investigates a process-centric and architecture-driven
approach to offer a software engineering perspective on enabling QCaaS - a.k.a
quantum service-orientation. We employed a two-phase research method comprising
(a) a systematic mapping study and (b) an architecture-based development, first
to identify the phases of the quantum service development life cycle and
subsequently to integrate these phases into a reference architecture that
supports QCaaS. The SMS process retrieved a collection of potentially relevant
research literature and based on a multi-step selection and qualitative
assessment, we selected 41 peer-reviewed studies to answer three RQs. The RQs
investigate (i) demographic details in terms of frequency, types, and trends of
research, (ii) phases of quantum service development lifecycle to derive a
reference architecture for conception, modeling, assembly, and deployment of
services, and (iii) The results identify a 4-phased development lifecycle along
with quantum significant requirements (QSRs), various modeling notations,
catalogue of patterns, programming languages, and deployment platforms that can
be integrated in a layered reference architecture to engineer QCaaS.

### [46] [AutoEmpirical: LLM-Based Automated Research for Empirical Software Fault Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04997)
*Jiongchi Yu,Weipeng Jiang,Xiaoyu Zhang,Qiang Hu,Xiaofei Xie,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLMs can significantly accelerate software fault analysis, reducing processing time from weeks to about 2 hours for 3,829 faults, though full automation remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional fault analysis is labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks for large-scale studies in complex software systems and slowing empirical research.

Method: Decomposed fault study into three phases (research objective, data preparation, fault analysis) and evaluated LLMs on 3,829 software faults from a high-quality empirical study.

Result: LLMs substantially improved efficiency with average processing time of about two hours compared to weeks of manual effort typically required.

Conclusion: LLMs show great potential for advancing empirical fault studies, but open challenges remain for achieving fully automated, end-to-end software fault analysis.

Abstract: Understanding software faults is essential for empirical research in software
development and maintenance. However, traditional fault analysis, while
valuable, typically involves multiple expert-driven steps such as collecting
potential faults, filtering, and manual investigation. These processes are both
labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating bottlenecks that hinder
large-scale fault studies in complex yet critical software systems and slow the
pace of iterative empirical research.
  In this paper, we decompose the process of empirical software fault study
into three key phases: (1) research objective definition, (2) data preparation,
and (3) fault analysis, and we conduct an initial exploration study of applying
Large Language Models (LLMs) for fault analysis of open-source software.
Specifically, we perform the evaluation on 3,829 software faults drawn from a
high-quality empirical study. Our results show that LLMs can substantially
improve efficiency in fault analysis, with an average processing time of about
two hours, compared to the weeks of manual effort typically required. We
conclude by outlining a detailed research plan that highlights both the
potential of LLMs for advancing empirical fault studies and the open challenges
that required be addressed to achieve fully automated, end-to-end software
fault analysis.
