We first present a\ntool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,\ncapturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,\nand augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the\ngap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph\nthrough a dual-stage retrieval pipeline.

We evaluate RANGER across four diverse\nbenchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question\nanswering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code\ncompletion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that\nuse embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B.

This prevents the agent from\nbeing useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a\nsoftware engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer\nduring code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an\nautomated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,\nimproves readability, implements a feature).\n  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be\nmanually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses\nfrom a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower\ndeveloper productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In\nthis paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided\nby a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high\nlevel, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's\nresponse and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis\ntools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.\n  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable\nerrors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the\nuninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to\nvalidate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program\nequivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8\nincorrect judgments made by the agent.", "AI": {"tldr": "A method to automatically validate code reasoning agent answers by verifying reasoning steps using formal verification tools, addressing trust issues in LLM-based agents.", "motivation": "LLM-based code reasoning agents often produce incorrect answers, preventing their use in high-precision scenarios like code understanding, code review, and automated code generation where trustworthiness is critical.", "method": "Extract formal representation of agent's response and use formal verification/program analysis tools to verify reasoning steps automatically.", "result": "On 20 uninitialized variable errors: validated 13/20 examples.
