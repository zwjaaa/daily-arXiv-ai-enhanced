Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers,\nwhich translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target\nfunction. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz\ndrivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models\nto automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers\nfrequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly\nstructured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially\ncrucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as\nreporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system\nand the team.\n  This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in\nOSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First,\nconstraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a\nfunction's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based\ncrash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether\nreported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark\nfunctions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes\nby up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that\nfrontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents.
