*Anderson de Lima Luiz*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: WARP is a system that uses LLMs and web-augmented synthesis to automatically detect and fix compilation errors in real-time by monitoring developer terminals and retrieving solutions from web sources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compilation errors are a major bottleneck in software development productivity, creating significant delays and frustration for developers.

Method: WARP actively monitors developer terminals, detects compilation errors, and combines fine-tuned Code-LLM understanding with relevant solutions, explanations, and code snippets retrieved from web sources like developer forums and documentation.

Result: On the CGP benchmark (C/C++, Python, Go errors), WARP achieves 72.5% correct compilation rate and higher semantic correctness compared to LLM-only approaches and traditional IDE quick-fixes.

Conclusion: Web-augmented synthesis with LLMs effectively addresses compilation errors, though handling noisy web data remains a key technical challenge for high-accuracy synthesis.

Abstract: Compilation errors represent a significant bottleneck in software development
productivity. This paper introduces WARP (Web-Augmented Real-time Program
Repairer), a novel system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and
dynamic web-augmented synthesis for real-time resolution of these errors. WARP
actively monitors developer terminals, intelligently detects compilation
errors, and synergistically combines the understanding of a fine-tuned Code-LLM
with relevant solutions, explanations, and code snippets retrieved from
up-to-date web sources like developer forums and official documentation.
Experimental results on our curated benchmark, CGP (featuring C/C++, Python,
and Go errors), demonstrate WARP achieves a superior fix rate (72.5 % Compiles
correctly) and higher semantic correctness compared to baseline LLM-only
approaches and traditional IDE quick-fixes. Key technical challenges in
achieving high-accuracy synthesis from noisy web data.

### [3] [Automated Code Development for PDE Solvers Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25194)
*Haoyang Wu,Xinxin Zhang,Lailai Zhu*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LLM-PDEveloper is a zero-shot multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE libraries by translating mathematical descriptions directly into source code, enabling continuous expansion of numerical PDE libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness LLMs' cross-domain knowledge and reasoning abilities for automating software development of numerical PDE libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers rather than just end users.

Method: A zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that translates mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code to generate new solvers/modules and adapt existing ones through an end-to-end math-to-code approach.

Result: Demonstrated on three tasks: building solvers for new PDEs, implementing new boundary conditions, and modifying existing solvers with additional terms, achieving moderate success rates. Identified and fixed syntactic errors, and analyzed mechanisms behind semantic errors.

Conclusion: LLM-PDEveloper enables a self-augmenting pipeline that continuously expands PDE library codebases, extends capacities, and broadens scope, though challenges remain with LLM-generated errors that require further research.

Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have
become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science,
engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge,
text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g.,
numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is
therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate
case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a
zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE
libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating
mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code,
LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This
end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that
continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and
broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a
solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an
existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success
rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we
propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain
semantic errors, guiding future research.

### [4] [Understanding Practitioners Perspectives on Monitoring Machine Learning Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25195)
*Hira Naveed,John Grundy,Chetan Arora,Hourieh Khalajzadeh,Omar Haggag*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Survey of 91 ML practitioners on monitoring practices, revealing challenges with runtime issues, automation difficulties, and desired improvements for ML monitoring tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand current ML monitoring practices from practitioners' perspective and identify challenges and improvement opportunities for detecting unwanted behavior in production ML systems.

Method: Conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners using qualitative and quantitative analyses to examine runtime issues, monitoring practices, challenges, and desired enhancements.

Result: Practitioners struggle with declining model performance, latency issues, and security violations. Most prefer automated monitoring but face challenges with setup complexity, resource strain, and alert fatigue. Manual approaches remain common due to automation limitations.

Conclusion: Future ML monitoring tools should focus on automated generation/deployment, better performance and fairness monitoring support, and issue resolution recommendations to better meet practitioners' needs.

Abstract: Given the inherent non-deterministic nature of machine learning (ML) systems,
their behavior in production environments can lead to unforeseen and
potentially dangerous outcomes. For a timely detection of unwanted behavior and
to prevent organizations from financial and reputational damage, monitoring
these systems is essential. This paper explores the strategies, challenges, and
improvement opportunities for monitoring ML systems from the practitioners
perspective. We conducted a global survey of 91 ML practitioners to collect
diverse insights into current monitoring practices for ML systems. We aim to
complement existing research through our qualitative and quantitative analyses,
focusing on prevalent runtime issues, industrial monitoring and mitigation
practices, key challenges, and desired enhancements in future monitoring tools.
Our findings reveal that practitioners frequently struggle with runtime issues
related to declining model performance, exceeding latency, and security
violations. While most prefer automated monitoring for its increased
efficiency, many still rely on manual approaches due to the complexity or lack
of appropriate automation solutions. Practitioners report that the initial
setup and configuration of monitoring tools is often complicated and
challenging, particularly when integrating with ML systems and setting alert
thresholds. Moreover, practitioners find that monitoring adds extra workload,
strains resources, and causes alert fatigue. The desired improvements from the
practitioners perspective are: automated generation and deployment of monitors,
improved support for performance and fairness monitoring, and recommendations
for resolving runtime issues. These insights offer valuable guidance for the
future development of ML monitoring tools that are better aligned with
practitioners needs.

### [5] [APRIL: API Synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25196)
*Hua Zhong,Shan Jiang,Sarfraz Khurshid*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: APRIL combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to improve API composition from large libraries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional component-based synthesis is costly and requires hand-crafted specifications, while LLMs often produce incorrect code due to hallucinations and limited contextual information.

Method: APRIL uses APO to iteratively refine prompts for a frozen model and RLVR to fine-tune the policy toward functional correctness, creating an efficient synthesis pipeline.

Result: Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from scientific Python libraries, APRIL achieved substantial improvements over instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs with expert prompts.

Conclusion: Integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

Abstract: APIs are central to modern software development, yet composing new APIs from
large libraries is difficult due to the exponential search space; traditional
component-based synthesis relies on costly exploration and hand-crafted
specifications. While large language models (LLMs) can generate implementations
from natural language, hallucinations and limited access to up-to-date
contextual information often yield incorrect code. In this paper, we present
APRIL, an approach that combines LLM-based synthesis with Automatic Prompt
Optimization (APO) and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR):
APO iteratively refines prompts for a frozen model, while RLVR fine-tunes the
policy toward functional correctness, producing an efficient synthesis
pipeline. Evaluated on 81 real-world APIs from widely used scientific Python
libraries and benchmarked against instruction-tuned but unfine-tuned LLMs
guided by expert prompts, APRIL achieves substantial improvements. These
results indicate that integrating APO and RLVR provides a robust, scalable path
for component-based API synthesis in large libraries.

TL;DR: RVBench is the first repository-level verification benchmark, and RagVerus framework combines retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to significantly improve automated proof synthesis for multi-module software projects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based verification methods focus on isolated function-level tasks and overlook cross-module dependencies and global contexts, which are crucial for scaling formal verification to real-world projects.

Method: Introduces RVBench benchmark from four open-source Verus projects, and RagVerus framework that synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting for proof synthesis.

Result: RagVerus triples proof pass rates on existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves 27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution for entire software repositories.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) suggest great promises in
code and proof generations. However, scaling automated formal verification to
real-world projects requires resolving cross-module dependencies and global
contexts, which are crucial challenges overlooked by existing LLM-based methods
with a special focus on targeting isolated, function-level verification tasks.
To systematically explore and address the significant challenges of verifying
entire software repositories, we introduce RVBench, the first verification
benchmark explicitly designed for repository-level evaluation, constructed from
four diverse and complex open-source Verus projects.
  We further introduce RagVerus, an extensible framework that synergizes
retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware prompting to automate proof
synthesis for multi-module repositories. RagVerus triples proof pass rates on
existing benchmarks under constrained model inference budgets, and achieves a
27% relative improvement on the more challenging RVBench benchmark,
demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification solution.

### [8] [Generating High-Quality Datasets for Code Editing via Open-Source Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25203)
*Zekai Zhang,Mingwei Liu,Zhenxi Chen,Linxi Liang,Yuxuan Chen,Guangsheng Ou,Yanlin Wang,Dan Li,Xin Peng,Zibin Zheng*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: CanItEdit is an open-source pipeline that uses multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets, creating OCEDataFT dataset of 20K samples. Fine-tuning models on this data significantly improves code editing performance, nearly matching GPT-4 without proprietary resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing commit-based datasets for code editing are noisy, lack diversity, and don't reflect real-world edit instructions, creating a need for better training data.

Method: Developed CanItEdit pipeline using multiple LLMs to generate both concise "lazy" and detailed "descriptive" code-edit instructions, with filtering based on diffs and topics to ensure quality and variety.

Result: Fine-tuned three base models on OCEDataFT dataset, achieving relative pass@1 improvements of 4.50% to 20.79% on CanItEdit benchmark, narrowing gap to GPT-4 to just 3.54%.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that high-quality synthetic data generation can significantly improve code editing models, achieving near state-of-the-art performance without proprietary resources or manual annotation.

Abstract: Code editing plays a vital role in software engineering, requiring developers
to adjust existing code according to natural language instructions while
keeping functionality intact and avoiding unnecessary modifications. However,
commit-based datasets commonly used for this task are often noisy, lack
diversity, and fail to reflect the style of real-world edit instructions. To
address this, we introduce CanItEdit, an open-source pipeline that leverages
multiple LLMs to synthesize realistic code-edit triplets. The pipeline produces
both concise "lazy" instructions and more detailed "descriptive" ones, and
applies filtering based on diffs and topics to guarantee data quality and
variety. Using this process, we construct OCEDataFT, a curated dataset of 20K
samples. Fine-tuning three advanced base models on OCEDataFT leads to
significant performance boosts on the CanItEdit benchmark, with relative pass@1
improvements ranging from 4.50% to 20.79%. Notably, the resulting models
achieve performance close to closed-source systems, narrowing the gap to GPT-4
to just 3.54%, without relying on proprietary resources or manual annotation.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MULocBench is a comprehensive dataset for issue localization that addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by including diverse issue types, root causes, and file types beyond just code files.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks for issue localization (SWE-Bench, LocBench) are limited as they focus mainly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring other evidence like commits, comments, configurations, and documentation.

Method: Created MULocBench dataset with 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects, offering greater diversity in issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types. Evaluated state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based prompting strategies.

Result: Performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain below 40% even at file level, revealing significant limitations in current techniques for generalizing to realistic, multi-faceted issue resolution.

Conclusion: Current issue localization techniques face substantial challenges in handling realistic scenarios, and MULocBench provides a more comprehensive testbed for future research in this area.

Abstract: Accurate project localization (e.g., files and functions) for issue
resolution is a critical first step in software maintenance. However, existing
benchmarks for issue localization, such as SWE-Bench and LocBench, are limited.
They focus predominantly on pull-request issues and code locations, ignoring
other evidence and non-code files such as commits, comments, configurations,
and documentation. To address this gap, we introduce MULocBench, a
comprehensive dataset of 1,100 issues from 46 popular GitHub Python projects.
Comparing with existing benchmarks, MULocBench offers greater diversity in
issue types, root causes, location scopes, and file types, providing a more
realistic testbed for evaluation. Using this benchmark, we assess the
performance of state-of-the-art localization methods and five LLM-based
prompting strategies. Our results reveal significant limitations in current
techniques: even at the file level, performance metrics (Acc@5, F1) remain
below 40%. This underscores the challenge of generalizing to realistic,
multi-faceted issue resolution. To enable future research on project
localization for issue resolution, we publicly release MULocBench at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/somethingone/MULocBench.

### [10] [Reinforcement Learning-Guided Chain-of-Draft for Token-Efficient Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25243)
*Xunzhu Tang,Iyiola Emmanuel Olatunji,Tiezhu Sun,Jacques Klein,Tegawende F. Bissyande*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiCoD is a reinforcement learning framework that selects the best solution from Chain-of-Draft generated candidates, improving code generation quality while reducing costs by over 50%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While Chain-of-Thought improves reasoning, it's verbose and inefficient. Chain-of-Draft offers concise reasoning but has variable solution quality due to LLM stochasticity.

Method: Uses strategy-guided prompting for diverse reasoning styles and models solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. Optimizes interpretable features (code complexity, reasoning structure, strategic metadata) through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency, and clarity.

Result: Outperforms or matches standard prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and Defects4J. Achieves over 50% cost reduction and improved response quality through multi-candidate design that charges only for selected output.

Conclusion: MultiCoD is more sustainable and scalable for real-world deployment, providing better LLM response quality while significantly reducing user billing costs through efficient candidate selection.

Abstract: LLMs demonstrate surface-level fluency in code generation but struggle with
structured reasoning tasks requiring correctness and semantic alignment. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances reasoning through intermediate steps,
it suffers from verbosity and inefficiency. Chain-of-Draft (CoD) prompting
offers more concise reasoning, but the stochastic nature of LLMs produces
varying solution quality, making optimal selection challenging. We propose
\multicod, a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the most
promising candidate from CoD-generated solutions. Our approach uses
strategy-guided prompting to encourage diverse reasoning styles and models
solution selection as a contextual bandit problem. The framework optimizes
interpretable features including code complexity, reasoning structure, and
strategic metadata through a reward function balancing correctness, efficiency,
and clarity. Experiments on MBPP, BigCodeBench, SWE-bench Verified, and
Defects4J show \multicod~outperforms and in some cases, on par with standard
prompting, CoT, and CoD baselines while achieving cost and token efficiency
from the user's perspective through a multi-candidate design that charges only
for the selected output, reducing user billing by over 50\% and improving LLM
response quality, making \multicod~more sustainable and scalable for real-world
deployment. Our code is available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MultiCoD.

### [11] [Protocode: Prototype-Driven Interpretability for Code Generation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25247)
*Krishna Vamshi Bodla,Haizhao Yang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents an automatic method for sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations to improve LLM code generation performance and interpretability, showing that high-quality demonstrations boost performance while poor ones degrade it.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Increasing reliance on LLMs for code generation raises risks of suboptimal and insecure code, highlighting the need for better ICL demonstration selection to improve model performance and interpretability.

Method: Used AST-based analysis on MBPP test set outputs to identify code regions influenced by demonstrations, and experimented with different ICL demonstration sampling strategies.

Result: High-quality ICL demonstrations improved interpretability and yielded positive performance improvement on pass@10 metric, while poorly chosen demonstrations negatively affected LLM performance compared to the base model.

Conclusion: Efficient sampling strategies for ICL demonstrations are crucial as they significantly impact model performance on code generation tasks.

Abstract: Since the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have been widely
adopted for various tasks such as text summarization, question answering,
speech-to-text translation, and more. In recent times, the use of LLMs for code
generation has gained significant attention, with tools such as Cursor and
Windsurf demonstrating the ability to analyze massive code repositories and
recommend relevant changes. Big tech companies have also acknowledged the
growing reliance on LLMs for code generation within their codebases. Although
these advances significantly improve developer productivity, increasing
reliance on automated code generation can proportionally increase the risk of
suboptimal solutions and insecure code. Our work focuses on automatically
sampling In-Context Learning (ICL) demonstrations which can improve model
performance and enhance the interpretability of the generated code. Using
AST-based analysis on outputs from the MBPP test set, we identify regions of
code most influenced by the chosen demonstrations. In our experiments, we show
that high-quality ICL demonstrations not only make outputs easier to interpret
but also yield a positive performance improvement on the pass@10 metric.
Conversely, poorly chosen ICL demonstrations affected the LLM performance on
the pass@10 metric negatively compared to the base model. Overall, our approach
highlights the importance of efficient sampling strategies for ICL, which can
affect the performance of the model on any given task.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Proposes BUILD-BENCH, a challenging benchmark for OSS compilation, and OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an LLM-based agent with enhanced build instruction retrieval that achieves SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods rely on manual rules and cannot adapt to customized OSS configurations. Recent LLM approaches underestimate real challenges like missing instructions and undocumented dependencies.

Method: Created BUILD-BENCH with diverse OSS projects and developed OSS-BUILD-AGENT with enhanced build instruction retrieval module adaptable to heterogeneous OSS characteristics.

Result: OSS-BUILD-AGENT achieves state-of-the-art performance on BUILD-BENCH and provides analysis of compilation method design choices.

Conclusion: BUILD-BENCH faithfully reflects agents' ability to handle complex compilation tasks and will spur innovation in software development and security applications.

Abstract: Automatically compiling open-source software (OSS) projects is a vital,
labor-intensive, and complex task, which makes it a good challenge for LLM
Agents. Existing methods rely on manually curated rules and workflows, which
cannot adapt to OSS that requires customized configuration or environment
setup. Recent attempts using Large Language Models (LLMs) used selective
evaluation on a subset of highly rated OSS, a practice that underestimates the
realistic challenges of OSS compilation. In practice, compilation instructions
are often absent, dependencies are undocumented, and successful builds may even
require patching source files or modifying build scripts. We propose a more
challenging and realistic benchmark, BUILD-BENCH, comprising OSS that are more
diverse in quality, scale, and characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a
strong baseline LLM-based agent, OSS-BUILD-AGENT, an effective system with
enhanced build instruction retrieval module that achieves state-of-the-art
performance on BUILD-BENCH and is adaptable to heterogeneous OSS
characteristics. We also provide detailed analysis regarding different
compilation method design choices and their influence to the whole task,
offering insights to guide future advances. We believe performance on
BUILD-BENCH can faithfully reflect an agent's ability to tackle compilation as
a complex software engineering tasks, and, as such, our benchmark will spur
innovation with a significant impact on downstream applications in the fields
of software development and software security.

### [13] [RANGER -- Repository-Level Agent for Graph-Enhanced Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25257)
*Pratik Shah,Rajat Ghosh,Aryan Singhal,Debojyoti Dutta*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: RANGER is a repository-level code retrieval agent that handles both code entity queries and natural language queries through a knowledge graph approach with dual-stage retrieval pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code retrieval systems primarily focus on code-entity queries, leaving a gap for handling natural language queries that describe tasks without explicit code entities.

Method: Constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies, then uses dual-stage retrieval: Cypher lookups for entity queries and MCTS-guided graph exploration for natural language queries.

Result: Outperforms retrieval baselines on CodeSearchNet and RepoQA, achieves superior cross-file dependency retrieval on RepoBench, and delivers highest exact match rate in code completion on CrossCodeEval when paired with BM25.

Conclusion: RANGER effectively bridges the gap between code entity queries and natural language queries in automated software engineering tasks through its knowledge graph approach and dual retrieval strategy.

Abstract: General-purpose automated software engineering (ASE) includes tasks such as
code completion, retrieval, repair, QA, and summarization. These tasks require
a code retrieval system that can handle specific queries about code entities,
or code entity queries (for example, locating a specific class or retrieving
the dependencies of a function), as well as general queries without explicit
code entities, or natural language queries (for example, describing a task and
retrieving the corresponding code). We present RANGER, a repository-level code
retrieval agent designed to address both query types, filling a gap in recent
works that have focused primarily on code-entity queries. We first present a
tool that constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of the entire repository,
capturing hierarchical and cross-file dependencies down to the variable level,
and augments graph nodes with textual descriptions and embeddings to bridge the
gap between code and natural language. RANGER then operates on this graph
through a dual-stage retrieval pipeline. Entity-based queries are answered
through fast Cypher lookups, while natural language queries are handled by
MCTS-guided graph exploration. We evaluate RANGER across four diverse
benchmarks that represent core ASE tasks including code search, question
answering, cross-file dependency retrieval, and repository-level code
completion. On CodeSearchNet and RepoQA it outperforms retrieval baselines that
use embeddings from strong models such as Qwen3-8B. On RepoBench, it achieves
superior cross-file dependency retrieval over baselines, and on CrossCodeEval,
pairing RANGER with BM25 delivers the highest exact match rate in code
completion compared to other RAG methods.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: TDDev is a test-driven development framework using LLM agents to automatically generate full-stack web applications from natural language descriptions or design images, achieving 14.4% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLM solutions for webpage generation are limited to front-end tasks and cannot produce fully functional applications, while full-stack development remains complex and time-consuming requiring diverse technical expertise.

Method: TDDev uses test-driven development approach where it automatically derives executable test cases, generates both front-end and back-end code, simulates user interactions, and iteratively refines implementation until all requirements are satisfied.

Result: TDDev achieves 14.4% improvement in overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality web applications without manual intervention.

Conclusion: The framework successfully addresses key challenges in full-stack automation including underspecified requirements, complex file interdependencies, and the need for both functional correctness and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Developing full-stack web applications is complex and time-intensive,
demanding proficiency across diverse technologies and frameworks. Although
recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable automated
webpage generation from visual inputs, current solutions remain limited to
front-end tasks and fail to deliver fully functional applications. In this
work, we introduce TDDev, the first test-driven development (TDD)-enabled
LLM-agent framework for end-to-end full-stack web application generation. Given
a natural language description or design image, TDDev automatically derives
executable test cases, generates front-end and back-end code, simulates user
interactions, and iteratively refines the implementation until all requirements
are satisfied. Our framework addresses key challenges in full-stack automation,
including underspecified user requirements, complex interdependencies among
multiple files, and the need for both functional correctness and visual
fidelity. Through extensive experiments on diverse application scenarios, TDDev
achieves a 14.4% improvement on overall accuracy compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing reliable, high-quality
web applications without requiring manual intervention.

### [15] [Detecting and Fixing API Misuses of Data Science Libraries Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25378)
*Akalanka Galappaththi,Francisco Ribeiro,Sarah Nadi*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: DSCHECKER is an LLM-based approach that detects and fixes API misuses in data science libraries by incorporating API directives and data information, achieving 61.18% detection F1-score and fixing 51.28% of misuses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data science libraries like scikit-learn and pandas present unique challenges for API misuse detection due to their data-centric nature, requiring specialized approaches beyond traditional methods.

Method: Uses LLMs with prompts incorporating API directives and data-specific details, and implements an adaptive function calling mechanism in DSCHECKER agent for real-world scenarios where misuse information is unknown.

Result: Best-performing model achieved 61.18% detection F1-score and fixed 51.28% of misuses. DSCHECKER agent achieved 48.65% detection F1-score and fixed 39.47% of misuses in real-world settings.

Conclusion: LLM-based approaches show promise for API misuse detection and fixing in data science libraries, with DSCHECKER demonstrating effectiveness in both controlled and real-world scenarios through adaptive information access.

Abstract: Data science libraries, such as scikit-learn and pandas, specialize in
processing and manipulating data. The data-centric nature of these libraries
makes the detection of API misuse in them more challenging. This paper
introduces DSCHECKER, an LLM-based approach designed for detecting and fixing
API misuses of data science libraries. We identify two key pieces of
information, API directives and data information, that may be beneficial for
API misuse detection and fixing. Using three LLMs and misuses from five data
science libraries, we experiment with various prompts. We find that
incorporating API directives and data-specific details enhances Dschecker's
ability to detect and fix API misuses, with the best-performing model achieving
a detection F1-score of 61.18 percent and fixing 51.28 percent of the misuses.
Building on these results, we implement Dschecker agent which includes an
adaptive function calling mechanism to access information on demand, simulating
a real-world setting where information about the misuse is unknown in advance.
We find that Dschecker agent achieves 48.65 percent detection F1-score and
fixes 39.47 percent of the misuses, demonstrating the promise of LLM-based API
misuse detection and fixing in real-world scenarios.

*Johan Linåker,Cailean Osborne,Jennifer Ding,Ben Burtenshaw*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes collaboration methods in open LLM development through interviews with developers from 14 projects worldwide, identifying key collaboration patterns, motivations, and organizational models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed, and identify opportunities to further foster the open LLM ecosystem, as current collaboration methods haven't been comprehensively studied.

Method: Exploratory analysis using semi-structured interviews with developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies across North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia.

Result: Three key findings: 1) Collaboration extends beyond LLMs to datasets, benchmarks, frameworks, forums, and compute partnerships; 2) Developers have diverse social, economic, and technological motivations; 3) Five distinct organizational models exist with varying centralization and community engagement strategies.

Conclusion: Provides practical recommendations for stakeholders to support global community building for a more open AI future, highlighting the diverse collaboration ecosystem in open LLM development.

Abstract: The proliferation of open large language models (LLMs) is fostering a vibrant
ecosystem of research and innovation in artificial intelligence (AI). However,
the methods of collaboration used to develop open LLMs both before and after
their public release have not yet been comprehensively studied, limiting our
understanding of how open LLM projects are initiated, organized, and governed
as well as what opportunities there are to foster this ecosystem even further.
We address this gap through an exploratory analysis of open collaboration
throughout the development and reuse lifecycle of open LLMs, drawing on
semi-structured interviews with the developers of 14 open LLMs from grassroots
projects, research institutes, startups, and Big Tech companies in North
America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. We make three key contributions to research
and practice. First, collaboration in open LLM projects extends far beyond the
LLMs themselves, encompassing datasets, benchmarks, open source frameworks,
leaderboards, knowledge sharing and discussion forums, and compute
partnerships, among others. Second, open LLM developers have a variety of
social, economic, and technological motivations, from democratizing AI access
and promoting open science to building regional ecosystems and expanding
language representation. Third, the sampled open LLM projects exhibit five
distinct organizational models, ranging from single company projects to
non-profit-sponsored grassroots projects, which vary in their centralization of
control and community engagement strategies used throughout the open LLM
lifecycle. We conclude with practical recommendations for stakeholders seeking
to support the global community building a more open future for AI.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: The paper presents a specialized model for automated environment setup that combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to achieve performance comparable to larger models on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environment setup is a persistent challenge in software engineering, and current LLMs have limited success in automating this task, which hinders both developer productivity and research scalability.

Method: Combined supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt the model specifically for environment setup tasks.

Result: On EnvBench-Python, the method enabled Qwen3-8B (runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models like Qwen3-32B and GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The proposed approach successfully addresses the limitation of current LLMs in environment setup automation, providing an efficient solution that performs competitively while being deployable on consumer hardware.

Abstract: Environment setup-the process of configuring the system to work with a
specific software project-represents a persistent challenge in Software
Engineering (SE). Automated environment setup methods could assist developers
by providing fully configured environments for arbitrary repositories without
manual effort. This also helps SE researchers to scale execution-based
benchmarks. However, recent studies reveal that even state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) achieve limited success in automating this task. To
address this limitation, we tune a specialized model for environment setup. We
combine supervised fine-tuning for generating correct Bash scripts and
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to adapt it to the task
of environment setup. On EnvBench-Python, our method enables Qwen3-8B (a model
runnable on consumer hardware) to perform on par with larger models-Qwen3-32B
and GPT-4o. The training code and model checkpoints are available online:

### [18] [BloomAPR: A Bloom's Taxonomy-based Framework for Assessing the Capabilities of LLM-Powered APR Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25465)
*Yinghang Ma,Jiho Shin,Leuson Da Silva,Zhen Ming,Jiang,Song Wang,Foutse Khomh,Shin Hwei Tan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: BloomAPR is a dynamic evaluation framework based on Bloom's Taxonomy that assesses LLM-powered automated program repair solutions across different cognitive reasoning levels, revealing limitations in current benchmarks and APR capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of LLM-powered APR solutions uses static benchmarks like Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from data contamination risks and limited ability to assess APR capabilities in dynamic contexts.

Method: Developed BloomAPR framework using Bloom's Taxonomy to evaluate LLM-powered APR solutions (ChatRepair and CigaR) across different reasoning levels, tested with three LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, StarCoder-2) using Defects4J as case study.

Result: LLM-powered APR solutions show strong performance on basic reasoning and pattern memorization (81.57% at Remember layer), improve with synthetic bugs (60.66% increase at Understand layer), but struggle with syntactic changes (43.32% at Apply layer) and real-world project bugs (13.46%-41.34% at Analyze layer).

Conclusion: Current benchmarks need evolution and BloomAPR provides foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering solutions, highlighting the gap between benchmark performance and real-world applicability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated the
development of AI-driven automated program repair (APR) solutions. However,
these solutions are typically evaluated using static benchmarks such as
Defects4J and SWE-bench, which suffer from two key limitations: (1) the risk of
data contamination, potentially inflating evaluation results due to overlap
with LLM training data, and (2) limited ability to assess the APR capabilities
in dynamic and diverse contexts. In this paper, we introduced BloomAPR, a novel
dynamic evaluation framework grounded in Bloom's Taxonomy. Our framework offers
a structured approach to assess the cognitive capabilities of LLM-powered APR
solutions across progressively complex reasoning levels. Using Defects4J as a
case study, we evaluated two state-of-the-art LLM-powered APR solutions,
ChatRepair and CigaR, under three different LLMs: GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama-3.1, and
StarCoder-2. Our findings show that while these solutions exhibit basic
reasoning skills and effectively memorize bug-fixing patterns (fixing up to
81.57% of bugs at the Remember layer), their performance increases with
synthetically generated bugs (up to 60.66% increase at the Understand layer).
However, they perform worse on minor syntactic changes (fixing up to 43.32% at
the Apply layer), and they struggle to repair similar bugs when injected into
real-world projects (solving only 13.46% to 41.34% bugs at the Analyze layer).
These results underscore the urgent need for evolving benchmarks and provide a
foundation for more trustworthy evaluation of LLM-powered software engineering
solutions.

TL;DR: AGNOMIN is an architecture-agnostic approach for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries using hierarchical graphs and neural networks, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in software reverse engineering, enabling vulnerability analysis and patching. Existing approaches struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse naming conventions.

Conclusion: AGNOMIN provides an effective architecture-agnostic solution for function name prediction that enables scalable security assessments and practical utility in real-world reverse engineering scenarios.

Abstract: Function name prediction is crucial for understanding stripped binaries in
software reverse engineering, a key step for \textbf{enabling subsequent
vulnerability analysis and patching}. However, existing approaches often
struggle with architecture-specific limitations, data scarcity, and diverse
naming conventions. We present AGNOMIN, a novel architecture-agnostic approach
for multi-label function name prediction in stripped binaries. AGNOMIN builds
Feature-Enriched Hierarchical Graphs (FEHGs), combining Control Flow Graphs,
Function Call Graphs, and dynamically learned \texttt{PCode} features. A
hierarchical graph neural network processes this enriched structure to generate
consistent function representations across architectures, vital for
\textbf{scalable security assessments}. For function name prediction, AGNOMIN
employs a Ren\'ee-inspired decoder, enhanced with an attention-based head layer
and algorithmic improvements.
  We evaluate AGNOMIN on a comprehensive dataset of 9,000 ELF executable
binaries across three architectures, demonstrating its superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with improvements of up to 27.17\% in
precision and 55.86\% in recall across the testing dataset. Moreover, AGNOMIN
generalizes well to unseen architectures, achieving 5.89\% higher recall than
the closest baseline. AGNOMIN's practical utility has been validated through
security hackathons, where it successfully aided reverse engineers in analyzing
and patching vulnerable binaries across different architectures.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper presents a preliminary checklist to help beginners choose appropriate modeling and simulation formalisms (DEVS, System Dynamics, Agent-Based Simulation) for complex ecosystems like digital twins and smart cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Complex dynamic ecosystems require modeling and simulation in software development, but beginners struggle to choose the right formalism among options like DEVS, System Dynamics, and Agent-Based Simulation.

Method: Developed a preliminary checklist with questions to guide beginners in selecting appropriate M&S formalisms, based on three main paradigms. Conducted a pilot study and consulted an expert for validation.

Result: Preliminary results show: (i) checklist suggestions aligned with formalisms chosen in original studies, and (ii) positive expert feedback on the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed checklist effectively assists beginners in selecting suitable modeling and simulation formalisms for complex ecosystem projects, with initial validation showing promising results.

Abstract: The advent of increasingly complex and dynamic ecosystems, such as digital
twins (DT), smart cities and Industry 4.0 and 5.0, has made evident the need to
include modeling and simulation (M&S) in the software development life cycle.
Such disruptive systems include simulation models in their own architecture
(such as DT) or require the use of simulation models to represent the high
degree of movement and the multiplicity of interactions that occur between the
involved systems. However, when software engineers (particularly the newcomers)
need to use M&S in their projects, they often pose themselves an important
question: which formalism should I use? In this direction, the main
contribution of this paper is the establishment of a preliminary checklist with
questions to assist beginners in M&S in choosing the most appropriate paradigm
to solve their problems. The checklist is based on three main formalisms: DEVS,
System Dynamics and Agent-Based Simulation. A pilot study was carried out and
an expert was consulted. The preliminary results show (i) conformance between
the suggestion given by the checklist and the formalism selected in the
original studies used as input for evaluating the checklist, and (ii) a
positive feedback from the expert.

### [21] [Explainable Fault Localization for Programming Assignments via LLM-Guided Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25676)
*Fang Liu,Tianze Wang,Li Zhang,Zheyu Yang,Jing Jiang,Zian Sun*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: FLAME is a fine-grained fault localization method for programming assignments that uses LLM-guided annotation and model ensemble to provide explainable, line-level error identification with educational value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fault localization techniques are too coarse-grained for educational contexts, operating at method level without explanations, and line-level approaches often use numerical line predictions that are ill-suited for LLMs.

Method: Uses LLM-guided annotation to identify faulty code lines with detailed explanations instead of direct line number prediction, and employs a weighted multi-model voting strategy to aggregate results from multiple LLMs.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on programming assignments, localizing 207 more faults at top-1 than the best baseline, and also generalizes well to general-purpose software codebases, outperforming all baselines on Defects4J benchmark.

Conclusion: FLAME provides effective fine-grained fault localization with explanatory feedback suitable for educational contexts while maintaining strong performance on general software codebases.

Abstract: Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming
assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete
assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated
Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in
identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges
when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method
level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for
students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While
some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on
predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to
LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained,
explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via
LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual
information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying
faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the
LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both
localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we
introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from
multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault
localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207
more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational
contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software
codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.

TL;DR: A novel technique for expanding code indexing to predict required APIs, enabling high-quality code generation for auto-completion and AI applications, with a compact 0.6B reranker that outperforms larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG applications, and there's a problem of API leaks in existing code-to-code benchmark datasets that don't capture unclear API usage intent.

Method: Introduced a new dataset from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes, developed a post-training pipeline with synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to optimize a compact 0.6B reranker.

Result: Achieved 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy and enabled the compact 0.6B reranker to outperform an 8B model while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency.

Conclusion: The approach effectively addresses enterprise-specific code nuances without the computational overhead of larger models, enabling real-time predictions for code generation applications.

Abstract: Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code
and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality,
end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We
address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by
introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that
capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation
metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy,
allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code
generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive
post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic
dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This
approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model
while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of
enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Evaluates classical code clone detection tools on AI-generated code clones, finding they remain effective but with performance variations compared to human-authored code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated code introduces new syntactic and semantic variations that challenge traditional code clone detection tools validated primarily on human-authored code.

Method: Systematically evaluated 9 widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench (GPT-3-generated clones) and compared with traditional benchmarks BigCloneBench and SemanticCloneBench.

Result: Classical CCD tools retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, with normalization techniques improving detection accuracy, but show performance variations compared to traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: Traditional code clone detection tools remain effective for AI-generated clones, with normalization playing a key role, but performance differences highlight the need for continued adaptation to AI-generated code patterns.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of AI-generated code has reshaped modern software
development, introducing syntactic and semantic variations in cloned code.
Unlike traditional human-written clones, AI-generated clones exhibit systematic
syntactic patterns and semantic differences learned from large-scale training
data. This shift presents new challenges for classical code clone detection
(CCD) tools, which have historically been validated primarily on human-authored
codebases and optimized to detect syntactic (Type 1-3) and limited semantic
clones. Given that AI-generated code can produce both syntactic and complex
semantic clones, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of classical CCD
tools within this new paradigm. In this paper, we systematically evaluate nine
widely used CCD tools using GPTCloneBench, a benchmark containing
GPT-3-generated clones. To contextualize and validate our results, we further
test these detectors on established human-authored benchmarks, BigCloneBench
and SemanticCloneBench, to measure differences in performance between
traditional and AI-generated clones. Our analysis demonstrates that classical
CCD tools, particularly those enhanced by effective normalization techniques,
retain considerable effectiveness against AI-generated clones, while some
exhibit notable performance variation compared to traditional benchmarks. This
paper contributes by (1) evaluating classical CCD tools against AI-generated
clones, providing critical insights into their current strengths and
limitations; (2) highlighting the role of normalization techniques in improving
detection accuracy; and (3) delivering detailed scalability and execution-time
analyses to support practical CCD tool selection.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: LogPilot is an intent-aware framework using LLMs for automated log-based alert diagnosis that improves root cause summarization by 50.34% and localization accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual log inspection for alert diagnosis is burdensome for engineers, and existing automated tools struggle with alert-agnostic log scoping and ineffective data organization for reasoning.

Method: Uses intent-aware approach to interpret alert definitions, reconstructs request executions into spatiotemporal log chains, clusters similar chains to identify patterns, and provides representative samples to LLMs for diagnosis.

Result: Achieves diagnosis time under one minute at $0.074 per alert, improves root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: LogPilot provides an automated and practical solution for service alert diagnosis that has been successfully deployed in production.

Abstract: Effective alert diagnosis is essential for ensuring the reliability of
large-scale online service systems. However, on-call engineers are often
burdened with manually inspecting massive volumes of logs to identify root
causes. While various automated tools have been proposed, they struggle in
practice due to alert-agnostic log scoping and the inability to organize
complex data effectively for reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce LogPilot, an intent-aware and scalable framework powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs) for automated log-based alert diagnosis. LogPilot
introduces an intent-aware approach, interpreting the logic in alert
definitions (e.g., PromQL) to precisely identify causally related logs and
requests. To achieve scalability, it reconstructs each request's execution into
a spatiotemporal log chain, clusters similar chains to identify recurring
execution patterns, and provides representative samples to the LLMs for
diagnosis. This clustering-based approach ensures the input is both rich in
diagnostic detail and compact enough to fit within the LLM's context window.
Evaluated on real-world alerts from Volcano Engine Cloud, LogPilot improves the
usefulness of root cause summarization by 50.34% and exact localization
accuracy by 54.79% over state-of-the-art methods. With a diagnosis time under
one minute and a cost of only $0.074 per alert, LogPilot has been successfully
deployed in production, offering an automated and practical solution for
service alert diagnosis.

*Simin Chen,Yixin He,Suman Jana,Baishakhi Ray*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: SWExploit is a method that generates adversarial GitHub issues to mislead LLM-based automated program repair agents into producing patches that are functionally correct but contain security vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current APR agents focus only on functional correctness while ignoring security risks. The openness of GitHub allows adversarial users to submit misleading issues that could exploit APR agents.

Method: SWExploit uses program analysis to find injection points, generates adversarial issues with misleading reproduction info while preserving semantics, and iteratively refines issues based on APR agent outputs.

Result: SWExploit achieved attack success rates up to 0.91 on correct patches, significantly higher than baseline ASRs below 0.20, across three agent pipelines and five backend LLMs.

Conclusion: The study challenges the assumption that patches passing all tests are secure, revealing critical limitations in current APR agent evaluation paradigms and highlighting security risks in LLM-based software maintenance.

Abstract: LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks
such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub
issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs.
However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of
APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while
largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like
GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an
important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on
GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct
but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which
generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce
patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in
three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points
for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading
reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue
semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements
based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent
pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that
are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the
correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20).
Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional
assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure,
highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR
agents.

TL;DR: R-Log is a reasoning-based paradigm for log analysis that uses step-by-step reasoning and reinforcement learning to overcome limitations of direct supervised fine-tuning, achieving better performance and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM approaches for log analysis use direct supervised fine-tuning which causes domain discrepancy with specialized log data, leading to overfitting and hallucinations due to imbalanced loss computation.

Method: Proposes R-Log with structured reasoning mimicking human engineers, using RL optimization in simulated O&M environment. Cold-started on 2k+ reasoning trajectories with 13 O&M strategies, then refined via RL with joint reward function.

Result: Outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, especially in unseen scenarios (228.05% improvement). R-Log-fast achieves 5x speedup while maintaining 93% efficacy.

Conclusion: R-Log's reasoning-based paradigm effectively addresses domain discrepancy and hallucination issues in log analysis, providing better generalization and performance compared to direct supervised fine-tuning approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of log data in modern software systems has prompted
the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated log analysis. Current
approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label
pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose
LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's
imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm
critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To
address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm
that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human
engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying
rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing
hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first
cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13
strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning
capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function.
Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing
methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by
228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the
efficacy.

Result: The paper presents the design decisions and evaluates GPT's accuracy in this context, including how different prompts affect task completion performance.

Conclusion: JiraGPT Next successfully addresses the challenge of complex data retrieval in project management by providing an accessible natural language interface powered by GPT.

Abstract: In the domain of Project Management, the sheer volume of data is a challenge
that project managers continually have to deal with. Effectively steering
projects from inception to completion requires handling of diverse information
streams, including timelines, budgetary considerations, and task dependencies.
To navigate this data-driven landscape with precision and agility, project
managers must rely on efficient and sophisticated tools. These tools have
become essential, as they enable project managers to streamline communication,
optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions in real-time.
However, many of these tools have steep learning curves and require using
complex programming languages to retrieve the exact data that project managers
need. In this work we present JiraGPT Next, a software that uses the GPT Large
Language Model to ease the process by which project managers deal with large
amounts of data. It is conceived as an add-on for Jira, one of the most popular
Project Management tools, and provides a natural language interface to retrieve
information. This work presents the design decisions behind JiraGPT Next and an
evaluation of the accuracy of GPT in this context, including the effects of
providing different prompts to complete a particular task.

### [28] [Evaluating the impact of code smell refactoring on the energy consumption of Android applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26031)
*Hina Anwar,Dietmar Pfahl,Satish N. Srirama*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes how code refactoring affects energy consumption in Android apps, finding that refactoring specific code smells like "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" can reduce energy consumption by up to 10.8%, but energy savings don't directly correlate with execution time changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Energy consumption of mobile devices can be improved by enhancing mobile app quality through frequent refactoring, as recent studies suggest.

Method: The study explores the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings in Android apps, analyzing permutations of code smell refactorings.

Result: Some code smell refactorings positively impact energy consumption, with "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" refactorings reducing energy by up to 10.8%. However, energy reduction doesn't directly correlate with execution time changes, and the impact of refactoring permutations was small.

Conclusion: More research is needed to investigate how factors like app size, age, developer experience, and number of contributors correlate with code smells and their refactoring impact on energy consumption and performance.

Abstract: Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of
attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption
of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps.
Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we
explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings
in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell
refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps.
Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce
energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption,
however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of
execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell
refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order
in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that
some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy
consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to
investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and
number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and
type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and
performance after refactoring.

*Dmitriy Kostunin,Vladimir Sotnikov,Sergo Golovachev,Abhay Mehta,Tim Lukas Holch,Elisa Jones*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: An agent-based approach for generating code using LLMs for specialized scientific libraries like Gammapy, addressing challenges of limited documentation and unstable APIs through controlled execution and validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Specialized scientific libraries often lack comprehensive documentation, examples, and community support compared to popular frameworks, making LLM-based code generation challenging due to unstable APIs and limited training data.

Method: Developed an agent that can write, execute, and validate code in a controlled environment specifically for the Gammapy library, with a web demo and benchmarking suite.

Result: Created a functional system for Gammapy code generation with execution and validation capabilities, though the paper reports current status rather than final performance metrics.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for specialized scientific libraries and outlines next steps for further development and improvement.

Abstract: Software code generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is one of the
most successful applications of modern artificial intelligence. Foundational
models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from
documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized
scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs
under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or
outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an
agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled
environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking
suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and
outlines next steps.

### [30] [A Multi-Language Object-Oriented Programming Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26111)
*Shuai Wang,Liang Ding,Li Shen,Yong Luo,Han Hu,Lefei Zhang,Fu Lin*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: MultiOOP is a multi-language object-oriented programming benchmark that addresses imbalances in existing code generation benchmarks by covering 6 programming languages with 267 tasks each, revealing significant performance degradation and limited multilingual generalization in LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing code generation benchmarks have major imbalances: 85.7% focus on single languages, 94.3% target only function/statement-level tasks, and over 80% have fewer than 10 test cases on average, limiting comprehensive evaluation of LLMs.

Method: Proposed MultiOOP benchmark covering Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript with 267 tasks per language. Developed a translator to extend single-language OOP benchmark, introduced pass@o metric for multilingual setting, and created automated test case augmentation framework.

Result: Evaluation of 14 LLMs showed: 1) 65.6 percentage point drop in pass@1 scores compared to function-level tasks; 2) GPT-4o mini achieved 48.06% in Python but only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages; 3) pass@o scores 1.1-19.2 points lower than pass@k, indicating LLMs generate executable code without fully understanding OOP concepts.

Conclusion: MultiOOP provides a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code generation, revealing substantial performance gaps and limited multilingual generalization that existing benchmarks fail to capture.

Abstract: Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating
intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35
existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single
programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level
tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address
these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming
benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an
existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual
setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases
to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream
LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial
performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6
percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2)
Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but
only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual
generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2
points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable
code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric
extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more
balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code
generation. Our code and data will be released at
https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and
https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.

*Lisi Qarkaxhija,Maximilian Carparo,Stefan Menzel,Bernhard Sendhoff,Ingo Scholtes*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Analyzing temporal activity patterns in OSS communities reveals bursty commit behavior driven by social interactions in co-editing networks, leading to activity cascades that can predict developer churn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding collective social behavior of developers is crucial for modeling OSS community dynamics and sustainability, particularly to explain the bursty nature of commit contributions.

Method: Network-based modeling framework using co-editing networks to capture developer interactions, with methods to identify activity cascades and develop churn prediction using data from 50 major OSS communities.

Result: Activity cascades are statistically significant in over half of studied projects, and insights enable development of practical churn prediction method to forecast which developers will leave.

Conclusion: Activity cascades are important emergent collective dynamics in OSS communities that help understand developer churn and retention in collaborative software projects.

Abstract: Understanding the collective social behavior of software developers is
crucial to model and predict the long-term dynamics and sustainability of Open
Source Software (OSS) communities. To this end, we analyze temporal activity
patterns of developers, revealing an inherently ``bursty'' nature of commit
contributions. To investigate the social mechanisms behind this phenomenon, we
adopt a network-based modelling framework that captures developer interactions
through co-editing networks. Our framework models social interactions, where a
developer editing the code of other developers triggers accelerated activity
among collaborators. Using a large data set on 50 major OSS communities, we
further develop a method that identifies activity cascades, i.e. the
propagation of developer activity in the underlying co-editing network. Our
results suggest that activity cascades are a statistically significant
phenomenon in more than half of the studied projects. We further show that our
insights can be used to develop a simple yet practical churn prediction method
that forecasts which developers are likely to leave a project. Our work sheds
light on the emergent collective social dynamics in OSS communities and
highlights the importance of activity cascades to understand developer churn
and retention in collaborative software projects.

*Rangeet Pan,Tyler Stennett,Raju Pavuluri,Nate Levin,Alessandro Orso,Saurabh Sinha*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: This paper analyzes characteristics of developer-written tests and compares them with automated test generation (ATG) tools to identify gaps in current ATG capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in understanding developer-written test characteristics and assessing how well ATG tools can generate realistic tests, despite decades of ATG research.

Method: Conducted an extensive empirical study of 1.7 million test cases from Java open-source repositories, analyzing test scope, fixtures, assertions, input types, and mocking usage.

Result: Most developer-written tests exhibit characteristics beyond current ATG tool capabilities, revealing significant gaps between automated generation and actual developer testing practices.

Conclusion: Identifies promising research directions to bridge the gap between current ATG tools and developer testing needs, aiming to advance the field toward generating more realistic tests.

Abstract: Automated test generation (ATG), which aims to reduce the cost of manual test
suite development, has been investigated for decades and has produced countless
techniques based on a variety of approaches: symbolic analysis, search-based,
random and adaptive-random, learning-based, and, most recently,
large-language-model-based approaches. However, despite this large body of
research, there is still a gap in our understanding of the characteristics of
developer-written tests and, consequently, in our assessment of how well ATG
techniques and tools can generate realistic and representative tests. To bridge
this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study of developer-written tests
for Java applications, covering 1.7 million test cases from open-source
repositories. Our study is the first of its kind in studying aspects of
developer-written tests that are mostly neglected in the existing literature,
such as test scope, test fixtures and assertions, types of inputs, and use of
mocking. Based on the characterization, we then compare existing tests with
those generated by two state-of-the-art ATG tools. Our results highlight that a
vast majority of developer-written tests exhibit characteristics that are
beyond the capabilities of current ATG tools. Finally, based on the insights
gained from the study, we identify promising research directions that can help
bridge the gap between current tool capabilities and more effective tool
support for developer testing practices. We hope that this work can set the
stage for new advances in the field and bring ATG tools closer to generating
the types of tests developers write.

### [33] [UniSage: A Unified and Post-Analysis-Aware Sampling for Microservices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26336)
*Zhouruixing Zhu,Zhihan Jiang,Tianyi Yang,Pinjia He*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: UniSage is a unified framework that samples traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware paradigm, performing anomaly detection and root cause analysis first to guide sampling, achieving superior coverage of critical data at low sampling rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing trace and log sampling approaches use sample-before-analysis, which discards failure-related information and hinders transparency in diagnosing distributed system behavior due to ever-growing data volumes.

Method: UniSage performs lightweight multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis on complete data streams first, then uses a dual-pillar sampling strategy: analysis-guided sampler for RCA-implicated data and edge-case-based sampler for rare critical behaviors.

Result: At 2.5% sampling rate, UniSage captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant logs, improves root cause analysis accuracy (AC@1) by 42.45%, and processes 10 minutes of telemetry data in under 5 seconds.

Conclusion: UniSage demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, providing comprehensive coverage of critical signals without excessive redundancy while being practical for production environments.

Abstract: Traces and logs are essential for observability and fault diagnosis in modern
distributed systems. However, their ever-growing volume introduces substantial
storage overhead and complicates troubleshooting. Existing approaches typically
adopt a sample-before-analysis paradigm: even when guided by data heuristics,
they inevitably discard failure-related information and hinder transparency in
diagnosing system behavior. To address this, we introduce UniSage, the first
unified framework to sample both traces and logs using a post-analysis-aware
paradigm. Instead of discarding data upfront, UniSagefirst performs lightweight
and multi-modal anomaly detection and root cause analysis (RCA) on the complete
data stream. This process yields fine-grained, service-level diagnostic
insights that guide a dual-pillar sampling strategy for handling both normal
and anomalous scenarios: an analysis-guided sampler prioritizes data implicated
by RCA, while an edge-case-based sampler ensures rare but critical behaviors
are captured. Together, these pillars ensure comprehensive coverage of critical
signals without excessive redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
UniSage significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. At a 2.5%
sampling rate, it captures 56.5% of critical traces and 96.25% of relevant
logs, while improving the accuracy (AC@1) of downstream root cause analysis by
42.45%. Furthermore, its efficient pipeline processes 10 minutes of telemetry
data in under 5 seconds, demonstrating its practicality for production
environments.

*Michelle Barker,Jeremy Cohen,Pedro Hernández Serrano,Daniel S. Katz,Kim Martin,Dan Rudmann,Hugh Shanahan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: Research institutions need robust policies to support research software development and sustainability, as current ad hoc approaches fail to adequately recognize software personnel and practices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Research software is crucial for modern science, but institutional policies lag behind, failing to support software personnel and best practices despite growing FAIR/open science momentum.

Method: The PRO4RS Working Group examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions worldwide through analysis of policy gaps and rationale.

Result: Identified critical policy gaps, particularly in recognizing research software personnel and integrating them into research assessment reform efforts.

Conclusion: Research-performing organizations must implement comprehensive policies to properly support research software development, use, and sustainability to maintain competitiveness.

Abstract: As research software becomes increasingly central to modern science,
research-performing organisations (RPOs) need to ensure that their investment
in people, skills and infrastructure around research software produces
sustainable and maintainable software that improves the research they perform,
which in turn improves the overall institution and its reputation and funding,
for example, by competing with peers who lack this approach. However, research
institution management and recognition of research software and its personnel
has mostly often developed in an ad hoc manner. RPO training infrastructures,
recognition and reward structures, have not developed at a sufficient rate to
support and encourage both the widespread use of research software best
practices and the long-term support for technical roles that is required. To
begin to address this fundamental problem for modern research environments,
RPOs must implement and adopt robust policies to support research software
development, use, and sustainability. Despite growing momentum from funders and
publishers around FAIR and open science principles, research
institutional-level policies specifically addressing research software remain
limited or lacking in breadth.
  This article outlines the work of the Policies in Research Organisations for
Research Software (PRO4RS) Working Group (WG), a joint initiative of the
Research Software Alliance (ReSA) and the Research Data Alliance (RDA), which
examined and advanced research software policy development across institutions
worldwide. After consideration of the rationale for institutional policies on
research software, the PRO4RS WG outputs and analysis are utilised to highlight
critical policy gaps, particularly related to consideration of research
software personnel in policy work focused on reform of research assessment.

### [35] [EQ-Robin: Generating Multiple Minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC Test Suites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26458)
*Robin Lee,Youngho Nam*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: EQ-Robin generates multiple minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC test suites by applying Robin's Rule to structurally equivalent Boolean expressions, addressing the risk of illegal test inputs in safety-critical software verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robin's Rule produces only one test suite, which fails if any required test case violates system constraints. This creates a critical coverage gap in safety-critical software verification.

Method: Systematically generates semantically equivalent Boolean expressions via algebraic rearrangements of ASTs, then applies Robin's Rule to each variant to produce diverse test suites.

Result: Produces multiple N+1 minimal test suites, providing resilience against illegal inputs while maintaining Unique-Cause MC/DC coverage guarantees.

Conclusion: EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for robust MC/DC coverage by generating alternative test suites when original ones contain illegal inputs, demonstrated on TCAS-II-derived expressions.

Abstract: Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC), particularly its strict
Unique-Cause form, is a cornerstone of safety-critical software verification. A
recent algorithm, "Robin's Rule," introduced a deterministic method to
construct the theoretical minimum of N+1 test cases for Singular Boolean
Expressions (SBEs). However, this approach yields only a single test suite,
introducing a critical risk: if a test case forming a required 'independence
pair' is an illegal input forbidden by system constraints, the suite fails to
achieve 100% coverage. This paper proposes EQ-Robin, a lightweight pipeline
that systematically generates a family of minimal Unique-Cause MC/DC suites to
mitigate this risk. We introduce a method for systematically generating
semantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an
Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying
Robin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be
produced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that
preserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.
We outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how
EQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage.

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: ErrorPrism is a system that automatically reconstructs error propagation paths in microservice systems by combining static analysis with LLM-based iterative backward search, achieving 97% accuracy on real-world errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error wrapping in microservices creates complex error chains that are difficult to trace back to their source, making root cause analysis challenging with existing approaches.

Method: Combines static analysis to build function call graphs and map log strings to functions, then uses an LLM agent for iterative backward search to reconstruct complete error paths.

Result: Achieved 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors across 67 production microservices at ByteDance, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: ErrorPrism provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial microservice systems by solving the error traceability problem.

Abstract: Reliability management in cloud service systems is challenging due to the
cascading effect of failures. Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern
microservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the
function call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from
its technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a
significant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation
path from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are
ineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism
in this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in
production microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on
service code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to
relevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space
for subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an
iterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop
error path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism
achieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,
outperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism
provides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial
microservice systems.

*Meghana Sistla,Gogul Balakrishnan,Pat Rondon,José Cambronero,Michele Tufano,Satish Chandra*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: A method to automatically validate code reasoning agent answers by verifying reasoning steps using formal verification tools, addressing trust issues in LLM-based agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-based code reasoning agents often produce incorrect answers, preventing their use in high-precision scenarios like code understanding, code review, and automated code generation where trustworthiness is critical.

Method: Extract formal representation of agent's response and use formal verification/program analysis tools to verify reasoning steps automatically.

Result: On 20 uninitialized variable errors: validated 13/20 examples. On 20 program equivalence queries: caught 6/8 incorrect judgments by the agent.

Conclusion: Formal verification can effectively validate code reasoning agent responses, improving trust and reducing need for manual verification.

Abstract: While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning
questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from
being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a
software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer
during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an
automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,
improves readability, implements a feature).
  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be
manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses
from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower
developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In
this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided
by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high
level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's
response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis
tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.
  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable
errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the
uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to
validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program
equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8
incorrect judgments made by the agent.

### [38] [Black-box Context-free Grammar Inference for Readable & Natural Grammars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26616)
*Mohammad Rifat Arefin,Shanto Rahman,Christoph Csallner*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: NatGI is an LLM-guided grammar inference framework that improves on existing tools by using bracket-guided exploration, LLM-driven generation, and hierarchical delta debugging to produce more accurate, scalable, and interpretable context-free grammars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing black-box grammar inference tools like Arvada, TreeVada, and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large, complex languages, creating a need for better approaches.

Method: Extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration using syntactic cues, LLM-driven bubble generation and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging for systematic tree simplification.

Result: NatGI consistently outperforms baselines with average F1 score of 0.57 (25pp higher than TreeVada), produces more interpretable grammars with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align with human intuition.

Conclusion: NatGI enables developers and researchers to achieve higher accuracy while maintaining the ability to easily inspect, verify, and reason about the structure and semantics of induced grammars.

Abstract: Black-box context-free grammar inference is crucial for program analysis,
reverse engineering, and security, yet existing tools such as Arvada, TreeVada,
and Kedavra struggle with scalability, readability, and accuracy on large,
complex languages. We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference
framework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key
innovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation
and non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for
systematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic
cues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while
LLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising
merges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the
grammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI
on a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones
such as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms
strong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score
of 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing
baseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars
perform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.
Leveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules
with meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more
closely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can
achieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and
reason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars.
