In this paper,\nwe investigate the relationship between the adoption of GenAI and developers'\nburnout. We utilized the Job Demands--Resources (JD--R) model as the analytic\nlens in our empirical study. We employed a concurrent embedded mixed-methods\nresearch design, integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence. We first\nsurveyed 442 developers across diverse organizations, roles, and levels of\nexperience. We then employed Partial Least Squares--Structural Equation\nModeling (PLS-SEM) and regression to model the relationships among job demands,\njob resources, and burnout, complemented by a qualitative analysis of\nopen-ended responses to contextualize the quantitative findings. Our results\nshow that GenAI adoption heightens burnout by increasing job demands, while job\nresources and positive perceptions of GenAI mitigate these effects, reframing\nadoption as an opportunity."}

After manual\nevaluation, 679 were confirmed as genuine hot fixes, of which 110 are\nreproducible using a test suite. Building upon the Bugs$.$jar framework,\nHotBugs$.$jar integrates these 110 reproducible cases and makes available all\n679 manually validated hot fixes, each enriched with comprehensive metadata to\nsupport future research. Each hot fix was systematically identified using Jira\nissue data, validated by independent reviewers, and packaged in a reproducible\nformat with buggy and fixed versions, test suites, and metadata.

RustAssure uses\nprompt engineering techniques to maximize the chances of the LLM generating\nidiomatic and safe Rust code. Moreover, because LLMs often generate code with\nsubtle bugs that can be missed under traditional unit or fuzz testing,\nRustAssure performs differential symbolic testing to establish the semantic\nsimilarity between the original C and LLM-transpiled Rust code. We evaluated\nRustAssure with five real-world applications and libraries, and showed that our\nsystem is able to generate compilable Rust functions for 89.8% of all C\nfunctions, of which 69.9% produced equivalent symbolic return values for both\nthe C and Rust functions."}

Benchmark and leadboards at\n  https://appforge-bench.github.io/", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in\nfunction-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world\napplications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must\norchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across\nstates over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the\nlifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately\nevaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software\nsystems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark\nconsisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android\napps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a\nlanguage model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android\napp from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding\nand coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations,\ncalling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To\nconstruct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize\nthe main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize\ntest cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation.\nFollowing rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE\nincorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that\nenables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily\nadoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all\nevaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model\n(GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting\nfundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex,\nmulti-component software engineering challenges."}

However, ensuring the correctness and robustness of\nMLIR itself remains challenging. Existing fuzzing approaches-based on manually\ncrafted templates or rule-based mutations-struggle to generate sufficiently\ndiverse and semantically valid test cases, making it difficult to expose subtle\nor deep-seated bugs within MLIR's complex and evolving code space. In this\npaper, we present FLEX, a novel self-adaptive fuzzing framework for MLIR. FLEX\nleverages neural networks for program generation, a perturbed sampling strategy\nto encourage diversity, and a feedback-driven augmentation loop that\niteratively improves its model using both crashing and non-crashing test cases.\nStarting from a limited seed corpus, FLEX progressively learns valid syntax and\nsemantics and autonomously produces high-quality test inputs. We evaluate FLEX\non the upstream MLIR compiler against four state-of-the-art fuzzers. In a\n30-day campaign, FLEX discovers 80 previously unknown bugs-including multiple\nnew root causes and parser bugs-while in 24-hour fixed-revision comparisons, it\ndetects 53 bugs (over 3.5x as many as the best baseline) and achieves 28.2%\ncode coverage, outperforming the next-best tool by 42%.

Mutational fuzzers aid compiler bug detection by\nsystematically mutating compiler inputs, i.e., programs. Their effectiveness\ndepends on the quality of the mutators used. Yet, no prior work used compiler\nbug histories as a source of mutators. We propose IssueMut, the first approach\nfor extracting compiler fuzzing mutators from bug histories. Our insight is\nthat bug reports contain hints about program elements that induced compiler\nbugs; they can guide fuzzers towards similar bugs. IssueMut uses an automated\nmethod to mine mutators from bug reports and retrofit such mutators into\nexisting mutational compiler fuzzers. Using IssueMut, we mine 587 mutators from\n1760 GCC and LLVM bug reports. Then, we run IssueMut on these compilers, with\nall their test inputs as seed corpora. We find that \"bug history\" mutators are\neffective: they find new bugs that a state-of-the-art mutational compiler\nfuzzer misses-28 in GCC and 37 in LLVM. Of these, 60 were confirmed or fixed,\nvalidating our idea that bug histories have rich information that compiler\nfuzzers should leverage."}

This\ndivision of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the\ncommunication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the\nprocess from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly\nasynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying\nfixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug\ntracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS\nplatforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking\nframework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model\n(LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing\ntime-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural\nlanguage, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request\nmissing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through\nno-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also\ngenerate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By\nintegrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response\ntimes, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices\nfor a more efficient, user-centric future."}
