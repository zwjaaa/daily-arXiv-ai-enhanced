We introduce a method for systematically generating\nsemantically equivalent SBEs by applying algebraic rearrangements to an\nAbstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the expression. By applying\nRobin's Rule to each structural variant, a diverse set of test suites can be\nproduced. This provides a resilient path to discovering a valid test suite that\npreserves the N+1 minimality guarantee while navigating real-world constraints.\nWe outline an evaluation plan on TCAS-II-derived SBEs to demonstrate how\nEQ-Robin offers a practical solution for ensuring robust MC/DC coverage."}

Error wrapping, a practice prevalent in modern\nmicroservice development, enriches errors with context at each layer of the\nfunction call stack, constructing an error chain that describes a failure from\nits technical origin to its business impact. However, this also presents a\nsignificant traceability problem when recovering the complete error propagation\npath from the final log message back to its source. Existing approaches are\nineffective at addressing this problem. To fill this gap, we present ErrorPrism\nin this work for automated reconstruction of error propagation paths in\nproduction microservice systems. ErrorPrism first performs static analysis on\nservice code repositories to build a function call graph and map log strings to\nrelevant candidate functions. This significantly reduces the path search space\nfor subsequent analysis. Then, ErrorPrism employs an LLM agent to perform an\niterative backward search to accurately reconstruct the complete, multi-hop\nerror path. Evaluated on 67 production microservices at ByteDance, ErrorPrism\nachieves 97.0% accuracy in reconstructing paths for 102 real-world errors,\noutperforming existing static analysis and LLM-based approaches. ErrorPrism\nprovides an effective and practical tool for root cause analysis in industrial\nmicroservice systems."}

This prevents the agent from\nbeing useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a\nsoftware engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer\nduring code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an\nautomated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug,\nimproves readability, implements a feature).\n  As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be\nmanually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses\nfrom a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower\ndeveloper productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In\nthis paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided\nby a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high\nlevel, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's\nresponse and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis\ntools to verify the agent's reasoning steps.\n  We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable\nerrors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the\nuninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to\nvalidate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program\nequivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8\nincorrect judgments made by the agent."}

We present NatGI, a novel LLM-guided grammar inference\nframework that extends TreeVada's parse tree recovery with three key\ninnovations: bracket-guided bubble exploration, LLM-driven bubble generation\nand non-terminal labeling, and hierarchical delta debugging (HDD) for\nsystematic tree simplification. Bracket-guided exploration leverages syntactic\ncues such as parentheses to propose well-structured grammar fragments, while\nLLM guidance produces meaningful non-terminal names and selects more promising\nmerges. Finally, HDD incrementally reduces unnecessary rules, which makes the\ngrammars both compact and interpretable. In our experiments, we evaluate NatGI\non a comprehensive benchmark suite ranging from small languages to larger ones\nsuch as lua, c, and mysql. Our results show that NatGI consistently outperforms\nstrong baselines in terms of F1 score. On average, NatGI achieves an F1 score\nof 0.57, which is 25pp (percentage points) higher than the best-performing\nbaseline, TreeVada. In the case of interpretability, our generated grammars\nperform significantly better than those produced by existing approaches.\nLeveraging LLM-based node renaming and bubble exploration, NatGI produces rules\nwith meaningful non-terminal names and compact structures that align more\nclosely with human intuition. As a result, developers and researchers can\nachieve higher accuracy while still being able to easily inspect, verify, and\nreason about the structure and semantics of the induced grammars."}
