Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly\nproposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely\nengineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes\nsoftware engineering program repair into four components governed by respective\nsub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch\nrevision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any\nindividual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined\nsub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific\nsub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on\nSWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and\n94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified.

Objectives: With the recent advances in the field\nof large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of\nLLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime,\nwithout human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated\nfour versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We\nperformed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two\ndifferent strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the\nconsistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b\nwas the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >=\n0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset\nversions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all\nmodels using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN\nqwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75.

Alerts help teams catch faults early before they turn into\nproduction outages and serve as first clues for troubleshooting. However,\ndesigning effective alerts is challenging. They need to strike a fine balance\nbetween catching issues early and minimizing false alarms. On top of this,\nalerts often cover uncommon faults, so the code is rarely executed and\ntherefore rarely checked. To address these challenges, several industry\npractitioners advocate for testing alerting code with the same rigor as\napplication code. Still, there's a lack of tools that support such systematic\ndesign and validation of alerts.\n  This paper introduces a new alerting extension for the observability\nexperimentation tool OXN. It lets engineers experiment with alerts early during\ndevelopment. With OXN, engineers can now tune rules at design time and\nroutinely validate the firing behavior of their alerts, avoiding future\nproblems at runtime."}
