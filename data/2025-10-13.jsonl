This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional,\nGUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction\nparadigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate\ntheir objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions\nacross multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However,\nextant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which\nintroduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For\nlanguage-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface\nparadigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative.\nThis limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of\nlocally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational\ncomponents for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine\nthe capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating\nuser intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is\nconducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess\nperformance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present\nstudy offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance\ntrade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable\ncomponents in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study\ninform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI\ninfrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes\nmore seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded\nintelligence."}

Each problem is paired with a verified solution\nfrom a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose\nGradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and\nmanipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate\nof 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent\nthat relies on a general-purpose shell.

By\nsubstituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during\ntranslation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the\ncode, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency\nand cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical\ninformation and produces translation results with reduced tokens."}

Ensuring the correctness of ML\nlibraries through testing is crucial. However, ML APIs often impose strict\ninput constraints involving complex data structures such as tensors. Automated\ntest generation tools such as Pynguin are not aware of these constraints and\noften create non-compliant inputs. This leads to early test failures and\nlimited code coverage. Prior work has investigated extracting constraints from\nofficial API documentation. In this paper, we present PynguinML, an approach\nthat improves the Pynguin test generator to leverage these constraints to\ngenerate compliant inputs for ML APIs, enabling more thorough testing and\nhigher code coverage. Our evaluation is based on 165 modules from PyTorch and\nTensorFlow, comparing PynguinML against Pynguin.

Yet most current\ndigital twin (DT) applications remain organ-specific or tied to isolated data\ntypes, lacking a unified and privacy-preserving foundation. This paper\nintroduces the Patient Medical Digital Twin (PMDT), an ontology-driven in\nsilico patient framework that integrates physiological, psychosocial,\nbehavioral, and genomic information into a coherent, extensible model.\nImplemented in OWL 2.0, the PMDT ensures semantic interoperability, supports\nautomated reasoning, and enables reuse across diverse clinical contexts. Its\nontology is structured around modular Blueprints (patient, disease and\ndiagnosis, treatment and follow-up, trajectories, safety, pathways, and adverse\nevents), formalized through dedicated conceptual views. These were iteratively\nrefined and validated through expert workshops, questionnaires, and a pilot\nstudy in the EU H2020 QUALITOP project with real-world immunotherapy patients.\nEvaluation confirmed ontology coverage, reasoning correctness, usability, and\nGDPR compliance. Results demonstrate the PMDT's ability to unify heterogeneous\ndata, operationalize competency questions, and support descriptive, predictive,\nand prescriptive analytics in a federated, privacy-preserving manner. By\nbridging gaps in data fragmentation and semantic standardization, the PMDT\nprovides a validated foundation for next-generation digital health ecosystems,\ntransforming chronic care toward proactive, continuously optimized, and\nequitable management."}

However, its\nadoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict\nprivacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering\n(MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies\non formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated\ntransformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At\nits core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that\nenables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning\npipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning\narchitecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw\npatient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving\nprivacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy\nstudy. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with\nsupport vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy\nin key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings\nsuggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated\ncode generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable,\nreproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms."}

However, mainstream LLM-based code translation methods suffer from two\ncritical limitations. First, they are highly sensitive to language-specific\nfeatures, which often introduce source-language syntax or lexicon into the\noutput, leading to syntactic confusion. Second, they lack fine-grained semantic\nalignment due to an over-reliance on function-level parallel datasets,\nresulting in semantic misalignment between the translated code and the original\nsource. To overcome these limitations, we propose TIT, a Tree-structured\nInstruction Tuning paradigm for LLM-based code translation. Specifically, TIT\nconsists of three modules. First, to mitigate syntactic confusion, the\nsyntactic information representation module integrates language-agnostic\nsyntactic features via structured parsing. Then, to generate high-quality\nfine-grained parallel data, the fine-grained parallel dataset augmentation\nmodule aligns nodes with code segments through statement-level segmentation and\ncontrastive matching. Finally, we leverage the dual-stage tree instruction\ntuning module to alleviate the contextual processing burden on the LLM caused\nby the introduction of syntactic information. The first stage employs\nsyntax-aware fine-tuning to enable the LLM to autonomously comprehend\nstructured syntactic information, while the second stage utilizes code\ngeneration fine-tuning to guide the model in generating accurate target code\nbased on function-level syntactic dependencies. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in multiple LLMs, achieving a success rate 1.22x-1.75x higher in\ncode translation while markedly reducing syntactic confusion."}
