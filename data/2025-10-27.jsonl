Evaluating the architecture of agents is\nparticularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the\nquality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including\ncompound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and\ncontinuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in\naddressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique\ncharacteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present\nAgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially\nto address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation.\nMoreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which\nserves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the\nagent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the\ncatalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world\ntax copilot, named Luna."}

While researchers have proposed text-based differencing\ntechniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing\nmethods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that\noperate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in\ndevelopers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or\nduplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent\nsuch block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling\ndevelopers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the\nefficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a\ntext-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of\nblock-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional\ndifferencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all\npossible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres\nalgorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size\nof the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's\nintent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five\nstate-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines\nand adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their\nperformance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental\nresults show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than\nbaseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our\nexperiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks\nregarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime\nefficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool."}

While previous studies\nhave proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit\nlimitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive\ntask-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the\npotential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot\nanalysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches\nbecause (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL)\nand (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization\napproach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync\ncarries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally\nconsiders the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns\nwhen retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2)\nMulti-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through\nlarge-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it\nprogressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively\ncorrect-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three\nCCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make\ncomparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both\nquantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the\ncomments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}"}

Their next\ngeneration is agent-based, operating with more autonomy and potentially without\nhuman oversight. One challenge is to provide AI agents with sufficient context\nabout the software projects they operate in. Like humans, AI agents require\ncontextual information to develop solutions that are in line with the target\narchitecture, interface specifications, coding guidelines, standard workflows,\nand other project-specific policies. Popular AI agents for software development\n(e.g., Claude Code) advocate for maintaining tool-specific version-controlled\nMarkdown files that cover aspects such as the project structure, building and\ntesting, or code style. The content of these files is automatically added to\neach prompt. AGENTS.md has emerged as a potential standard that consolidates\ntool-specific formats. However, little is known about whether and how\ndevelopers adopt this format. Therefore, in this paper, we present the results\nof a preliminary study investigating the adoption of AI configuration files in\n466 open-source software projects, what information developers provide in these\nfiles, how they present that information, and how they evolve over time. Our\nfindings indicate that there is no established structure yet, and that there is\na lot of variation in terms of how context is provided (descriptive,\nprescriptive, prohibitive, explanatory, conditional). We see great potential in\nstudying which modifications in structure or presentation can positively affect\nthe quality of the generated content. Finally, our analysis of commits that\nhave modified AGENTS.md files provides first insights into how projects\ncontinuously extend and maintain these files.

DL models\nsupport perception modules, equipped with tasks such as object detection and\nsensor fusion. These DL models enable vehicles to process multi-sensor inputs\nto understand complex surroundings. Deploying DL models in autonomous driving\nsystems faces stringent challenges, including real-time processing, limited\ncomputational resources, and strict power constraints. To address these\nchallenges, automotive DL frameworks (e.g., PaddleInference) have emerged to\noptimize inference efficiency. However, these frameworks encounter unique\nquality issues due to their more complex deployment environments, such as\ncrashes stemming from limited scheduled memory and incorrect memory allocation.\nUnfortunately, existing DL framework testing methods fail to detect these\nquality issues due to the failure in deploying generated test input models, as\nthese models lack three essential capabilities: (1) multi-input/output tensor\nprocessing, (2) multi-modal data processing, and (3) multi-level data feature\nextraction. These capabilities necessitate specialized model components, which\nexisting testing methods neglect during model generation. To bridge this gap,\nwe propose Scalpel, an automotive DL frameworks testing method that generates\ntest input models at the model component level. Scalpel generates models by\nassembling model components (heads, necks, backbones) to support capabilities\nrequired by autonomous driving systems. Specifically, Scalpel maintains and\nupdates a repository of model components, generating test inputs by selecting,\nmutating, and assembling them. Successfully generated models are added back to\nenrich the repository. Newly generated models are then deployed within the\nautonomous driving system to test automotive DL frameworks via differential\ntesting."}

In\nthis study we explore the demand for conjoint requirements and system\nspecification for PbD and suggest an approach to address this demand. Methods:\nWe reviewed secondary and related primary studies and conducted interviews with\npractitioners to (1) investigate the state-of-practice and (2) understand the\nunderlying specification objectives and goals (e.g., traceability). We\ndeveloped and evaluated an approach for requirements and systems specification\nfor PbD, and evaluated it against the specification objectives.
