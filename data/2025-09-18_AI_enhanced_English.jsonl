The Overlooked Ethical Dimensions of GenAI in Software Modeling Education", "comment": "8 pages, Educators Symposium at MODELS 2025", "summary": "Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly gaining momentum in\nsoftware modeling education, embraced by both students and educators. As GenAI\nassists with interpreting requirements, formalizing models, and translating\nstudents' mental models into structured notations, it increasingly shapes core\nlearning outcomes such as domain comprehension, diagrammatic thinking, and\nmodeling fluency without clear ethical oversight or pedagogical guidelines.\nYet, the ethical implications of this integration remain underexplored.\n  In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review across six major\ndigital libraries in computer science (ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore,\nScopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and Web of Science). Our aim is to\nidentify studies discussing the ethical aspects of GenAI in software modeling\neducation, including responsibility, fairness, transparency, diversity, and\ninclusion among others.\n  Out of 1,386 unique papers initially retrieved, only three explicitly\naddressed ethical considerations. This scarcity highlights the critical absence\nof ethical discourse surrounding GenAI in modeling education and raises urgent\nquestions about the responsible integration of AI in modeling curricula, as\nwell as it evinces the pressing need for structured ethical frameworks in this\nemerging educational landscape. We examine these three studies and explore the\nemerging research opportunities as well as the challenges that have arisen in\nthis field.", "AI": {"tldr": "Systematic review finds only 3 out of 1,386 papers address ethical considerations of GenAI in software modeling education, revealing critical gap in ethical discourse and need for frameworks.", "motivation": "GenAI is rapidly being adopted in software modeling education without clear ethical oversight or pedagogical guidelines, shaping core learning outcomes while ethical implications remain underexplored.", "method": "Conducted systematic literature review across six major computer science digital libraries (ACM, IEEE, Scopus, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Web of Science) to identify studies discussing ethical aspects of GenAI in software modeling education.", "result": "Only 3 papers out of 1,386 unique papers explicitly addressed ethical considerations, highlighting a critical absence of ethical discourse in this field.", "conclusion": "There is an urgent need for structured ethical frameworks and responsible integration of GenAI in modeling curricula, with emerging research opportunities and challenges requiring immediate attention."}}

SWE-Bench has emerged as the most\nwidely adopted benchmark for evaluating progress in this area. While LLM-based\nagentic tools show great promise, they still fail on a substantial portion of\ntasks. Moreover, current evaluations primarily report aggregate issue-solving\nrates, which obscure the underlying causes of success and failure, making it\nchallenging to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements. To\nbridge this gap, we first analyze the performance and efficiency of three SOTA\ntools, spanning both pipeline-based and agentic architectures, in automated\nissue solving tasks of SWE-Bench-Verified under varying task characteristics.\nFurthermore, to move from high-level performance metrics to underlying cause\nanalysis, we conducted a systematic manual analysis of 150 failed instances.\nFrom this analysis, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of failure modes\ncomprising 3 primary phases, 9 main categories, and 25 fine-grained\nsubcategories. Then we systematically analyze the distribution of the\nidentified failure modes, the results reveal distinct failure fingerprints\nbetween the two architectural paradigms, with the majority of agentic failures\nstemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks. Motivated by these\ninsights, we propose a collaborative Expert-Executor framework. It introduces a\nsupervisory Expert agent tasked with providing strategic oversight and\ncourse-correction for a primary Executor agent. This architecture is designed\nto correct flawed reasoning and break the cognitive deadlocks that frequently\nlead to failure. Experiments show that our framework solves 22.2% of previously\nintractable issues for a leading single agent. These findings pave the way for\nbuilding more robust agents through diagnostic evaluation and collaborative\ndesign.", "AI": {"tldr": "This paper analyzes failure modes in automated issue solving on SWE-Bench, develops a taxonomy of 25 failure subcategories, and proposes an Expert-Executor framework that solves 22.2% of previously intractable issues.", "motivation": "Current evaluations of automated issue solving tools only report aggregate success rates, which obscure the underlying causes of failure and make it difficult to diagnose model weaknesses or guide targeted improvements.", "method": "The authors analyzed performance of three state-of-the-art tools on SWE-Bench-Verified, conducted manual analysis of 150 failed instances to develop a comprehensive failure taxonomy, and proposed a collaborative Expert-Executor framework with supervisory oversight.", "result": "The analysis revealed distinct failure patterns between pipeline-based and agentic architectures, with agentic failures mainly stemming from flawed reasoning and cognitive deadlocks.

To investigate\nthese trade-offs, we conduct an empirical study based on code generation\nbenchmarks. The results reveal that longer CoT does not always help.
