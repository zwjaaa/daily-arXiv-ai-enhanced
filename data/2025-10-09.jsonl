In many\nsoftware teams, cybersecurity experts are either entirely absent or represented\nby only a small number of specialists. As a result, the workload for these\nexperts becomes high, and software engineers would need to conduct\ncybersecurity activities themselves. This creates a need for a tool to support\ncybersecurity experts and engineers in evaluating vulnerabilities and threats\nduring the risk assessment process. This paper explores the potential of\nleveraging locally hosted large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented\ngeneration to support cybersecurity risk assessment in the forestry domain\nwhile complying with data protection and privacy requirements that limit\nexternal data sharing. We performed a design science study involving 12 experts\nin interviews, interactive sessions, and a survey within a large-scale project.\nThe results demonstrate that LLMs can assist cybersecurity experts by\ngenerating initial risk assessments, identifying threats, and providing\nredundancy checks. The results also highlight the necessity for human oversight\nto ensure accuracy and compliance. Despite trust concerns, experts were willing\nto utilize LLMs in specific evaluation and assistance roles, rather than solely\nrelying on their generative capabilities. This study provides insights that\nencourage the use of LLM-based agents to support the risk assessment process of\ncyber-physical systems in safety-critical domains."}

Employing iterative software development and user-centered\ndesign methodologies, the system was integrated within a real-world university\nenvironment. Empirical evaluation, including usability testing and student\nfeedback, indicated significant improvements in assignment tracking,\ncollaboration, and submission efficiency. Students reported positive\nexperiences using distributed version control workflows, highlighting improved\nlearning outcomes and reduced administrative burden. Challenges related to\ninitial adoption and student learning curves were identified and mitigated\nthrough iterative improvements. The proposed system contributes practical\ninsights for integrating distributed version control into educational settings,\nenhancing both instructor oversight and student engagement in software\nengineering and related disciplines. Based on our results, the research showed\nthat 85% of instructors found the git based system easier to use, with 84% of\nstudents preferring it over traditional methods, as it provides a 38% reduction\nin time taken for submission and review, while also leading to a 48% reduction\nin storage requirements."}

Model-driven engineering (MDE), with its systematic\nnature of code derivation, offers systematic methods to integrate accessibility\nconcerns into software development while reducing manual effort. This paper\npresents a systematic literature review on how MDE addresses accessibility for\nvision impairments. From 447 initially identified papers, 30 primary studies\nmet the inclusion criteria. About two-thirds reference the Web Content\nAccessibility Guidelines (WCAG), yet their project-specific adaptions and\nend-user validations hinder wider adoption in MDE. The analyzed studies model\nuser interface structures, interaction and navigation, user capabilities,\nrequirements, and context information. However, only few specify concrete\nmodeling techniques on how to incorporate accessibility needs or demonstrate\nfully functional systems. Insufficient details on MDE methods, i.e.,\ntransformation rules or code templates, hinder the reuse, generalizability, and\nreproducibility. Furthermore, limited involvement of affected users and limited\ndeveloper expertise in accessibility contribute to weak empirical validation.\nOverall, the findings indicate that current MDE research insufficiently\nsupports vision-related accessibility. Our paper concludes with a research\nagenda outlining how support for vision impairments can be more effectively\nembedded in MDE processes."}

However, composing a relevant context for\ncode completion poses challenges in large repositories: First, the limited\ncontext length of LLMs makes it impractical to include all repository files.\nSecond, the quality of generated code is highly sensitive to noisy or\nirrelevant context. In this paper, we present our approach for the ASE 2025\nContext Collection Challenge. The challenge entails outperforming JetBrains\nbaselines by designing effective retrieval and context collection strategies.\nWe develop and evaluate a series of experiments that involve retrieval\nstrategies at both the file and chunk levels. We focus our initial experiments\non examining the impact of context size and file ordering on LLM performance.\nOur results show that the amount and order of context can significantly\ninfluence the performance of the models. We introduce chunk-based retrieval\nusing static analysis, achieving a 6% improvement over our best file-retrieval\nstrategy and a 16% improvement over the no-context baseline for Python in the\ninitial phase of the competition. Our results highlight the importance of\nretrieval granularity, ordering and hybrid strategies in developing effective\ncontext collection pipelines for real-world development scenarios."}

Conducting systematic reviews is laborious,\nespecially during the screening or study selection phase, where the number of\npapers can be overwhelming. During this phase, papers are assessed against\ninclusion and exclusion criteria based on their titles and abstracts. Recent\nresearch has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can perform\ntitle-abstract screening at a level comparable to that of a master's student.\nWhile LLMs cannot be fully trusted, they can help, for example, in Rapid\nReviews, which try to expedite the review process. Building on recent research,\nwe developed AiSysRev, an LLM-based screening tool implemented as a web\napplication running in a Docker container. The tool accepts a CSV file\ncontaining paper titles and abstracts. Users specify inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria. One can use multiple LLMs for screening via OpenRouter. AiSysRev\nsupports both zero-shot and few-shot screening, and also allows for manual\nscreening through interfaces that display LLM results as guidance for human\nreviewers.We conducted a trial study with 137 papers using the tool. Our\nfindings indicate that papers can be classified into four categories: Easy\nIncludes, Easy Excludes, Boundary Includes, and Boundary Excludes. The Boundary\ncases, where LLMs are prone to errors, highlight the need for human\nintervention. While LLMs do not replace human judgment in systematic reviews,\nthey can significantly reduce the burden of assessing large volumes of\nscientific literature.

Despite their importance, the proposal process\nis resource-intensive and often leads to contributor frustration, especially\nwhen proposals are declined without clear feedback. Yet, the reasons behind\nproposal rejection remain poorly understood, limiting opportunities to\nstreamline the process or guide contributors effectively. This study\ninvestigates the characteristics and outcomes of proposals in the Go\nprogramming language to understand why proposals are declined and how such\noutcomes might be anticipated. We conduct a mixed-method empirical study on\n1,091 proposals submitted to the Go project. We quantify proposal outcomes,\nbuild a taxonomy of decline reasons, and evaluate large language models (LLMs)\nfor predicting these outcomes. We find that proposals are more often declined\nthan accepted, and resolution typically takes over a month. Only 14.7% of\ndeclined proposals are ever resubmitted. Through qualitative coding, we\nidentify nine key reasons for proposal decline, such as duplication, limited\nuse cases, or violations of project principles. This taxonomy can help\ncontributors address issues in advance, e.g., checking for existing\nalternatives can reduce redundancy. We also demonstrate that GPT-based models\ncan predict decline decisions early in the discussion (F1 score = 0.71 with\npartial comments), offering a practical tool for prioritizing review effort.\nOur findings reveal inefficiencies in the proposal process and highlight\nactionable opportunities for improving both contributor experience and reviewer\nworkload by enabling early triage and guiding contributors to strengthen their\nproposals using a structured understanding of past decline reasons."}

Grounded in Value\nSensitive Design (VSD), CRAI-MCF is built upon an empirical analysis of 240\nopen-source projects, distilling 217 parameters into an eight-module,\nvalue-aligned architecture.
